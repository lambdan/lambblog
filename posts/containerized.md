# Containerizing

This is just a dumb test post. 

Up until now, I've run a Python script manually to rebuild this entire blog, and then the output files would get copied into a folder on my ye olde Apache server.

Now I've converted it into a Docker container, and it should get build/pushed automatically when I commit this post and "release" it.

Might remove this post later. It's really just a test.
