Do you ever really beat this game?

No, you don't really, you can't get the credits to scroll. But I finished the main quest so I guess that will suffice.

I have never actually finished this game before, but I got the vibe to play it last fall, and so I've been playing it on and off until now.

I kinda like it! The music is beautiful, its visually pleasing (some things look dated but generally it still looks great I think).

Only thing I can really complain about is bugs. I had one night where I nearly lost 2 hours of progress because I only used quick saves and autosaves and I had saved after I had gotten into a softlock state. 
Fortunately I had not closed the game, and so Steam had not uploaded my cloud saves. So I figured I could maybe get them from there somehow. So I unplugged my computer from the internet and started googling and eventually found this obscure web page: [https://store.steampowered.com/account/remotestorage](https://store.steampowered.com/account/remotestorage).

From there I could download my saves from 2 hours prior and restore them. Phew. That was scary. Hopefully maybe someone will find this page if they have the same issue.

Anyway, now I'm gonna get into adding mods to the game. I figured I should play it through once vanilla before I start modding. Though, truth be told, I did use some mods for this first playthrough, but they were just QoL mods (SkyUI and a DLSS enabler).

Here's two pretty screenshots I took along the ride.
