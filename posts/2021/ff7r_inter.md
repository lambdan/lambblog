# Game Beaten: FF7R INTERmission (the Yuffie DLC)

The very definition of short and sweet?

- Was short, 9 hours ish. Probably could've been 7ish if I hadn't stopped and grinded the box challenge.
- Yuffie is cute and fun, but still kinda meh overall. Didn't care for her in the original either. 
- The Fort Condor minigame was surprisingly fun. I am a bit worried it will be awful on Hard difficulty, but on Normal it was fun.

The Yuffie DLC isn't too much to get hyped about, but FF7R being on PS5 is something hyped about. It is vastly improved in many ways. It's worth getting a PS5 just for the load times alone:

I don't really have much else to say. Get INTERgrade for the load times and 60 FPS. Consider this Yuffie DLC a bonus.
