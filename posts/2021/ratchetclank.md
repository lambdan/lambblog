# Game Beaten: Ratchet & Clank (2016)

Had this game on my todo list for a good while but just finally got around to it, mostly thanks to the 60 FPS patch on PS5 and Rift Apart coming soon.

And yeah, it was fun. Not great or outstanding or anything, but fine. It looked really good which makes me very curious in Rift Apart which apparently looks even better.

Don't have much else to say. If you want a Sunday project this is a good candidate. Its fun and pretty short (12 hours for me).

--------------------------

On a sadder note, this was the game I was playing when I heard the news that a relative of mine had passed away from covid. He went from feeling "slightly off" to dead in less than two weeks. This was the first relative of mine to pass away from covid, so it was the first one that hit hard. I now associate this game with that event.
