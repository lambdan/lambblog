# What do I do now?

I just finished rewatching Friends. Again. For like the 4th time. And there's always this post-series depression I get: what the hell do I do now? 

For weeks now I've just been able to turn on the TV and immediately know what I'm gonna watch. And now I can't. Now I gotta pick a new show. 

This feeling of not knowing what to watch is something I get with every show that I finish watching. It's like the show becomes part of your daily schedule and once that isn't part of your schedule anymore, you feel broken. 

The good news is that I can now start compiling all the notes I made of the Friends episodes into one gigantic post. I'm actually kind of afraid if my blog engine will handle it. It will be 10x larger than anything else I've done. 
I do dread editing it though. I have a lot to say and a lot of pictures to show.
