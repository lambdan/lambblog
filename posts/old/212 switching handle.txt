# On Switching My Twitter @

Ever since I joined Twitter, I've been using `@djs__` but now I am `nadbmal`.

Why?

- I hate numbers and symbols in usernames. Obviously I would prefer just `djs` but that's not available or is too short.
- I'm sick of DJ's (disc jockey's) reaching out to me
- `djs__` looks very messy and hacky.
- I hate the username `lambdan` but I love `nadbmal`. Mostly because it just looks elegant and natural, probably because it starts with a `n`, as in _neutral_.

Why didn't I do this earlier?

- I didn't think of it.
- When I thought of it, I saw that it was unavailable, but then I realized that I am the one who has taken it, on one of my many many Twitter alts (I don't use any of them, but I have some usernames taken). So now that other account is `@djs__` instead.

What about elsewhere?

- I won't change it elsewhere for now. New accounts will probably be `nadbmal`.
- I bought the domain `nadbmal.com`. For now it just redirects to `lambdan.se`.

Basically, all that's changed is my twitter @. Not even my display name is changed.
