# Steam In-home Streaming

Steam In-home Streaming is something that you might be very skeptical to at first. Transferring inputs to a video game through LAN and getting a video & audio stream back is just weird.

But when you plug in a PS3 Controller to a Mac Mini running OSX, having Steam being ran in Big Picture mode and the controller gets detected "and it just works", you know Valve is up to something.
