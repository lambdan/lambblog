# Dynamic sitemap with PHP

I needed to create a sitemap for my blog. Upon googling I learned that every single blog post I make needs to be in that sitemap, so I took my Archive page, which basically lists all my blog posts and modified it a little:

    <?php
    include 'lib/getPostData.php';
    header('Content-type: text/xml');
    echo '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>';
    echo '<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">';
  
        $dir = 'posts/';
        $content = array_diff(scandir($dir), array('..', '.', '.htaccess'));
        natcasesort($content); // Sort content
        foreach (array_reverse($content) as $c) {
            $number = preg_split("/[\s,.]+/", $c);
            $path = $dir . $c;
            echo '<url><loc>' . getPostData($path, "link") . '</loc></url>';
        }

        echo '<url><loc>http://lambdan.se</loc></url>';

        echo '</urlset>';
    ?>

Ofcourse, depending on how your blog works it will be different. For mine I have a `getPostData.php` which you could say is the core of my blog. It allows me to get links, content, teasers, images, etc. from my Markdown files.

Anyway, the principle is:

- Set header to Content-type: text/xml
- Echo out XML version
- Echo out urlset xmlns
- loop over all blog posts and make them echo out `<url><loc>http://URL</loc></url>`.
- At the bottom you can add any additional <url>'s you want that might be static
- Finally echo out `</urlset>`

Save it as `sitemap.php`. Now you need to modify your `.htaccess`, to add a RewriteRule that will make `/sitemap.xml` into `/sitemap.php`:

    RewriteRule ^sitemap\.xml sitemap.php

And done! You can see my sitemap by going to http://lambdan.se/sitemap.xml

Update
======

Upon posting this post I noticed that I got redirected to my sitemap.xml for some reason when I clicked the permalink to this post. The original title of the post was "Dynamic sitemap.xml with PHP", so I removed the .xml part and now it works. 
You can still see the same bug by going to something like: http://lambdan.se/94/random-string-sitemap-xml

I guess the sitemap rewriterule gets triggered on sitemap-xml too.


Update 2

Thanks to help [from Twitter](https://twitter.com/spimmmm/status/726381932750229504) the above issue was fixed and I updated the RewriteRule in the guide accordingly.
