# Carrie Fisher Died

News just broke and for some reason I am very bummed about it. 

A couple of days ago, when she had a heart attack and was later reported to be "stable" I tweeted out a genuine [phew](https://twitter.com/djs__/status/812451369865084928). 

I don't know why I care really. I didn't know her. She was not my favorite character in any of the Star Wars movies (I don't really have any favorite characters in Star Wars now that I'm thinking about it.) 

I guess I liked how "cool" she was. She was really different, seemed to have a chill look on life, and she was open about it. By far the most interesting of the cast for the original movies. 

I guess another factor is just that, you don't want actors from your favorite movies to die. You want the heroes to live on forever. 
I don't know why I say heroes either, Princess Leia wasn't a hero to me. 

I don't know, it's just one of those things. I felt like writing about it, to pay my respects. I know a lot of other people have died in 2016, but this was the first one I was genuinely bummed about. And it was so close to go on to next year. 

I have a lot of wonderings about what will happen with *Episode VIII* now, but for now I'll just say this:

**Rest In Peace **

_Update 29 Dec 2016_

Carrie Fisher's mother, _Debbie Reynolds_ has now also passed away. I feel really sorry and sad for the family and anyone who knew them. A lot to take in, in just 2 days.

I find it comforting to think that she wanted to be with her daughter.
