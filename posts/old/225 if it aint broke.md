# If It Ain't Broke Don't Fix It

I started dabbling with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)  today and was starting to consider replacing my own trusty [lambblog](https://github.com/lambdan/lambblog) with it, but in the end I decided not to.

While it would be nice to use something that other people use, that has tons of documentation and plugins, I don't really have a need for it.

Sure, it would be nice to use [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) to have a nice organized way of handling post metadata, instead of doing my "natural" style:

    Date
    Title
    
    Body text.......

Sure, it would be nice to have tags. I even tried them out on Jekyll and yeah it was great. 

Maybe someday I'll migrate over to it. I even tested the RSS importer and yep, it could import my whole blog good enough. It had some issues but it would be ok. 
Big problem is that it doesn't get tags or anything so I'd have to add that in post.

But for now I'll keep on using _lambblog_. I have a Jekyll environment setup so I'll mess with it whenever I feel like it. Maybe tomorrow, maybe never.
