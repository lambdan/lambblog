# Xbox (D)one

I'm done with the Xbox One. I was just cleaning my room and I decided to clean up some stuff around the TV setup and I decided to get rid of the Xbox One.

It was just taking up space, dusting a lot, and I used it once a month. So I put it in my wardrobe, and later this year I'll go up to the attic to get the box and put it away.

I won't sell it, because I don't like selling big things such as consoles. They are annoying to ship and you don't get that much money.

__So where did it go wrong?__

Well, to be honest, it was never right to begin with. I never really, really wanted a Xbox One. Reason I got it initially was for playing Destiny with a friend. I had been playing it alot on Xbox 360 and I wanted to play it with this friend, who have a Xbox One.
Around this time the Xbox One was starting to go pretty cheap too. I think I paid less than $300 and I got Halo: Master Chief Collection with that.
Destiny was awesome on it. The controls were great, graphics were great, and I love Destiny.

So I enjoyed the week or so I played Destiny with my friend, and then the time I played it myself after he quit. I also played through Halo 1 & 2 on the MCC and had decently fun with those (see [Games I beat in 2015](https://lambdan.se/blog/2015/12/27/games-i-beat-in-2015-and-my-game-of-the-year/).)
I also got Diablo 3 when it went on sale during the summer and had fun playing that while binge watching Orange Is The New Black.

Then Rare Replay came out and I had a blast with that. I loved playing through Banjo-Kazooie on it. Lots of fun.

Somewhere around here the new Xbox One dashboard came out and I really hated that thing. I felt like it crippled the console. While I didn't like the navigation of the older dashboard either, this one wasn't any better! It was just slower and even more confusing in my opinion.

Then I also got Halo 5, because everyone was praising it, and the gameplay was fun. So I got it, for pretty much full price, beat the campaign, and then played multiplayer for a week and I was done with it.

And since then, my Xbox One was basically just dusting.

Around November 2015 I got a PS4 instead and had fun playing MGS5 on it and just liked it better as a console. The controller was nice. Not that I didn't mind the Xbox One controller either but I had a problem with mine (I'll come back to that later.) The PS4 felt a lot faster everywhere and just felt like the better console to play on. The dashboard was easy, fast and nice.

So the time between Rare Replay-Halo 5, and Halo 5-present, my Xbox One was just dusting. It was useless for everything.

I tried using it as a media player. The Plex and Netflix apps are nice, but my Xbox One has a defective fan in it so it makes a ticking sound which is super annoying. Even then, the PS4 was better for media as it has a 3.5mm headphone port I could utilize late at night.

I tried using it as a blu-ray player. It was useless at that too. My AVCHD Harmy Star Wars wouldn't play on it, and when I tried a regular blu-ray it was just slow and loud as hell.

And that was it. The Xbox One is useless in every aspect to me.

- It has no exclusives I'm interested in
- Console exclusives are better on the PS4
- Mine has a defective fan
- My controller has a defective stick that also makes a tick noise when rotated
- It's big
- It's glossy black
- It's dusting

So, good bye Xbox One. Maybe one day I'll take you out again, when you have some exclusive I want or I really, really, __really__ wanna play Rare Replay (not very often I want to).
