# HTTPS

I finally got HTTPS running on my website, thanks to *Let's Encrypt*. 
I've wanted to use their service months ago or whenever it was first opened up for use, but I couldn't get it running on my old VPS, because of many reasons probably. 

Well anyway now I got it running very fast and simple without any issue. 
Or well, I had to move out all my *VirtualHosts* that I had in a single configuration file (`000-default.conf`) and make them have individual configurations files in Apache's sites-available folder, but after that it went without a hitch. 

Enjoy? I guess?
