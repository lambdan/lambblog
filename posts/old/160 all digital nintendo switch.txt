# 99% Digital with the Switch?

I'm a big fan of getting physical versions of games. The cases usually look nice and they're nice to have on your shelf. 
But lately, I've started preferring digital versions on my _PS4_. Mostly because I don't have to get up and get the cases and swap the discs if I wanna play another game, and also _PSN_ has had some nice sales recently, got both _Final Fantasy XV_ and _The Witcher 3 GOTY_ on there, for a good price if you ask me.

So the _Nintendo Switch_ is soon here. As we all know, it's a hybrid console kinda. You can use it on the go and docked to your TV. I'm estimating I will have mine docked to the TV 99% of the time.
I rarely feel like taking anything but my phone with me when I go out. I have never brought my 3DS outside for example.

In the past I have been really against buying digital games on Nintendo consoles, as Nintendo used to do it really retardedly: the games you bought were tied to the console, not you.
Meaning, if I bought a game on my _Wii U_, and then it broke, I would have to re-buy that game, or do a lot of rain dancing with _Nintendo Customer Support_.

But now, [Nintendo is tying your purchases to your account][a], so now I can feel comfortable buying games on there, digitally.

Combine that, with the fact that the Switch might sometimes be used portable, it would make a lot of sense to go all digital.

I can't go 100%, because I have pre-ordered _Breath of the Wild_ <sup>[1](#1)</sup> and I plan on keeping the pre-order as the eShop might be overloaded or something on day 1. I don't wanna risk messing up my pre-order either (it's on the same order as the console itself.)

Combine this with how much plastic is wasted on a Switch game, it might be reasonable to go full digital for this console.

We'll see though. We'll see how cute the _Breath of the Wild_ case is, and what it feels like to take out and put in a cartridge both into the case and into the console. If it's a good feeling, it might be worth getting physical versions, for some games.

What I do right now with the PS4 is that I buy whatever is cheapest. _FFXV_ and _Witcher 3_<sup>[2](#2)</sup> happened to be less expensive digitally so I went with that.
I will probably end up doing this strategy for the Switch as well.

<a name="1"></a>1. If you prefix the title with Zelda, the game no longer makes sense to me. It makes much more sense, and I get excited for it, if I think of the game as _Breath of the Wild_, and not _Zelda: Breath of the Wild_

<a name="2"></a>2. Cheapest would've been to not get it at all, as I have the game on PC, but I am very conflicted about PC vs Console so I end up with both versions... sigh...
