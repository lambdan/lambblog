# Going Ultrawide

I ordered a _Dell U3417W_ today. A 34", Ultrawide 21:9, 3440x1440 IPS display. Notably it has no adaptive sync technology and only runs at 60 Hz.

Now why did I do this?

Well, frankly it was kind of impulsive. I even tried to go through my web browser history to see how I got there and there is no conclusive trail.

Why did I choose this monitor, the _Dell U3417W_?

- It's a ultrawide 3440x1440. I'm hoping to make this my only display on my desk. And I'm hoping the 1440 resolution will look sharp enough that I don't miss Retina.
- I play very little games. Almost none, atleast not on PC, so high refresh rates and G-Sync was not a requirement.
- It's an IPS panel. I am never using TN again after my _Dell S2716DG_ fiasco.
- *Apparently* my [mid-2014 rMBP](https://lambdan.se/214.2018.04.06-all-macbooks-currently-suck) can use it in 3440x1440@60 Hz. I say apparently because Apple docs says it can't, but there are plenty of comments and forum threads where people say it works. I will test.
- The monitor has a built-in KVM switch and this is really cool, I wish all monitors had it. This was the biggest reason why I went with this monitor instead of any other alternative. Basically, I will hook up my keyboard, mouse and headset (all USB) to the monitor. And then I will have two USB cables from the monitor, one goes to Computer A and one goes to Computer B. Then whenever I switch input source between the computers it will automatically redirect the USB ports.
- Dell monitors are designed nicely and don't look epic.

We'll see how it works out. I am kind of excited.

My only concern is if I ever play a game in fullscreen, and I want to watch something on the side. Can't really do that with one single screen, unless you run the game windowed (which I guess I could do since I can't use G-Sync anyway.)
