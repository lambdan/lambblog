# Essential Things to Do after Clean Windows Install

I finally reinstalled Windows today after I've been meaning to do it for months. ~~I went with Windows 7 for fun. I have nothing against Windows 10, really, but I just wanted 7 for fun.~~ A few hours later I installed Windows 10 instead. 

Anyway, I decided to write down all the things I need to do to get a barely functioning (for me) install of Windows, inspired by [Casey Liss](https://www.caseyliss.com/2016/7/2/new-mac-who-dis).

----------

# Before wiping C:

- Backup the entirety of `C:\Users\youruser\`
- Check for save files in %appdata% *cough* Dark Souls 3 *cough* Lego Star Wars *cough* Minecraft *cough* and back them up
- Copy Windows ISO to USB using [Rufus](https://rufus.akeo.ie/)
- Copy drivers and preferably a Ninite installer (see below) to the USB
- Shut down PC
- Unplug ethernet and other peripherals that aren't necessary during installation
- Power on PC, and boot from USB

# Installation of Windows

Nothing to point out here. If the drive is over 500 GB, I recommend partitioning it to have ~200 GB for the OS, and the rest for storage. 

# Post-Installation

## Drivers

(Preferably these will already be downloaded onto a USB or other HDD)

- Install motherboard drivers if needed (on Windows 7):
	- LAN
	- Audio
	- Chipset
	- USB 3
- Install graphics card drivers after internet is connected (so it can install .NET Framework and other requirements)
	- If Nvidia: uncheck Nvidia Geforce Experience
- Reboot

## Monitors

- Enable 144 Hz on main monitor
- Set other monitor position to be in the middle:

## For Windows 10: Disable Tracking

- Download and run [DWT](https://github.com/10se1ucgo/DisableWinTracking/releases)
- Check all boxes except the ones that warn you and apply

## Activate

Depends on your situation, but Windows should be activated before moving on

## Installing software

- Browse to [Ninite](https://ninite.com) and make an installer with (preferably this installer has been done before and stored on USB or other HDD so you don't need to browse with IE):
	- Chrome
	- Essentials
	- qBittorrent
	- 7-Zip
	- WinRAR
	- VLC
	- Spotify
	- Dropbox
	- Python (2.7)
	- Filezilla
	- Notepad++
	- Classic Start (if Windows >7)
	- LibreOffice
	- SumatraPDF
	- Steam
	- Everything (if on Windows 10, you need to use a [beta version](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/) in order to add network drives)
- Reboot

## Map Network Drives

## Set up Dropbox and 1Password

- Set up Dropbox and wait for 1Password folder in Apps folder to sync

- While we're in Gmail, copy the 1Password license key and put it in 1Password

## Set up WhatPulse

(If you know your WhatPulse password without needing 1Password, I would do this as soon as you get network drivers working, for accuracy's sake)

- Install [WhatPulse](http://whatpulse.org/), cancel the WinPcap install to avoid network monitoring)
