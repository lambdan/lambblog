# Game Beaten: Earthbound

I started writing a long post on this game.
Too long.
I __might__ go back and finish it and publish it later. Like in a few months or years. (Seriously, no guarantees I'll go back.)

There is a ton of stuff I want to eventually say about this game. 

But for now all I can say is:
- This game is incredible. It's just so crazy and original. A genre of it's own.
- The inventory system and everything related to that sucks. I feel like half the time I spent playing the game was spent doing inventory.
- The graphics are super cute and I like them a lot. They hold up very well today.
- The battle backgrounds are amazing, and remind me of homebrew demos
- The final battle is probably my favourite final battle of any game ever? It was quite amazing, and touching.
- It is not my favourite game of all time. But at least top 20 probably. Favourite SNES game? Right now: sure! Later on: potentially.

Overall, a cult classic.

Oh, and getting Homesick is annoying, but super cute.

Here are some photos I took of my TV while playing Earthbound:

<figcaption>Yeah my name is George Costanza. I wonder how many others have used this name? Seinfeld was very popular in 94/95 (the game wasn't though).</figcaption>

So this will have to do until I do my longer post about Earthbound. If I ever...
