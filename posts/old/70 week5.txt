# Week 5

Solid week. Nothing to really complain about. 

## Hot

- Got my WeMo bulbs to work
- Played a lot of PvP Destiny. Rift is a really fun game mode. 
- Ordered all the seasons of Seinfeld that I was missing on DVD. 
- Got to work a few days and had fun there. 

## Not

- To get the WeMo to work I had to create a wifi network on my Mac Mini. Apparently the WeMo doesn't like my router. 
- WeMo works inconsistently. Sometimes it's instant, sometimes it's not. 
- The NAS is down to 120 GB of free space.
