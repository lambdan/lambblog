# Game Beaten: Uncharted: The Lost Legacy (PS4)

Pretty good, like a 8/10. Pretty short too, but I was kind of expecting that since it is more or less a DLC for _Uncharted 4_.

Characters were good, I liked _Chloe_. Both spoke with an accent or lisp or something though which was kind of annoying, but it adds character I guess.
Game was fun like Uncharted 4, puzzles were good and so on.

Anyway, here's some very heavily compressed JPEG screenshots from the PS4 so you can see how pretty the game is. Just like _Uncharted 4_, I think this is one of the best looking games ever. And I didn't even play it with a PS4 Pro with HDR and 4K and stuff.

If you liked Uncharted 4, you'll like this one too I think.
