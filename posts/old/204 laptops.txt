# Laptops...

I miss having  a laptop.

Here's the problem: the only laptops I like are made by Apple, and they're expensive.

The other problem: I only use a laptop, once, or maybe twice, a week. So getting an expensive MacBook (doesn't matter if it's new or used) just doesn't make sense since I use it so little.

So why do I miss having a laptop? 
Well, I miss having it for writing blog posts. 

I find it incredibly uncomfortable to sit by my desktop computer and write these things. 
Writing them on my phone is doable but not comfortable either, as writing on the phone for long periods of time is not comfortable.
I have an iPad, but as soon as you wanna do something else, other than write, it's inconvenient.

But a laptop is perfect. I lie down, I put it on my lap or stomach, and type away. 

So what am I typing this on? 

I am using a 2011 or 2012, very cheap 15.6" laptop. You know those that are like $300. 
It's fairly usable since I put a SSD in it, back in 2011/2012, and I currently run _Lubuntu_ which is pretty light weight. But the laptop is very big and heavy, doesn't have usable battery, and the keyboard is clunky. And the trackpad is terrible.
So it works, but it's not that comfortable either. 

Ideally, I'd get something like a 13" Macbook Air. But that feels very outdated, so I'd prefer something like a 13" rMBP, but then we're way up in price. 

And even a 13" Macbook Air is too expensive for what little I do. 

I don't really know what to do. 

Maybe quit the blog.
