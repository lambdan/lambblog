# RDR2: My Final Decision

I’ve given it some more time and now I think I can give my final verdict.

*Red Dead Redemption 2 is not my Game of the Year.*

I really like RDR 2, and it’s absolutely amazing what Rockstar has managed from all aspects: technically, story, details, audio, animals, characters... just everything is tip top and absolutely deserves all the praise it gets. 

Can I say RDR 2 is the best game of the year and Spider-Man is the most fun game of the year, and since I value fun over best, I’ll say Spider-Man is my game of the year?
