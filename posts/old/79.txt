# Week 9

Pretty lazy week, but at the same time not.

## Hot

- Gotten back into Starcraft 2. Been playing and watching it alot. Fun stuff.
- Wrote a long & messy post about the PS3. You can read it [here](http://blog.lambdan.se/78/playstation-3)
- Managed to replace the battery in a Iphone 5C for a friend. Was shaky but I didn't break anything!

## Not

- Last episode of Mythbusters have aired
- Spent money, majority of it was towards getting a drivers license though
- Still haven't managed to create a AVCHD version of Star Wars Silver Screen Edition
