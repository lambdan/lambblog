# Cheap RGB Cable vs More Expensive RGB Cable
http://lambdan.se/d/CheapCableVSExpensiveCable/

Again, so I remember where I put it.
Trying to motivate myself to buy another expensive one. I have one for my N64 but I want another one so I don't have to swap with the SNES.

I would buy from http://retrogamingcables.co.uk/ 

(not a sponsored post, but that would be cool though)
