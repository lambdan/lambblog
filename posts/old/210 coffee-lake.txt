# The Coffee Lake Build

I got [the new parts][newparts], and I built the new computer, and I love it.
I love how it looks, I love how silent it is, and I love that it's running on Intel again.

Building this PC was fun, but took a very long time because I wanted to think through what the best order to things were, and I wanted to route all cables cleanly since this is the first I am using that had a windowed side panel.

The final part list is:

So yes, the parts are quite expensive. But please note that I didn't buy all of this instantly. All of these parts have been collected over the years. I don't drop $3000 on a computer just like that. I re-use old parts.

Some day I plan on writing on why monitors today sucks. There is nothing good out there. I want "Retina", G-Sync, IPS and good build quality. That basically doesn't exist.

<figcaption>This is a pretty good picture of the finished product, except that I have replaced all the fans with Noctua's now (which you'll see further down) and I removed the warning sticker.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Building the computer was fun until I turned it around and saw what a mess the backside was. I was afraid I wasn't gonna get the panel back on because if you look at the SATA Power connections for the SSDs, you can see that they bulge out quite a bit. But closing the panel was no problem at all.</figcaption>

<figcaption>One of the first pictures I took while overclocking to 5 GHz. Ultimately I don't run it at 5 GHz anymore though, it was a bit too hot (loud) for my liking.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Here's a picture where you can see that all fans are now entirely replaced by various Noctua models. And it is so quiet.</figcaption>

(x264 transcode of _Friends S05E21_ using [Don Melton's Video Transcoding script][donmelton], at 1080p 6000 kbps with the medium-preset. AC3 audio passed through. The version of Handbrake and the script used is not always the same.)

I overclocked my 8700K using this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoUtA7DKXhU), although I only watched the BIOS section. But it was nice and short. 

Ultimately, my overclock is 4.7 GHz at 1.18 volts, with no AVX Offset.
I am happy with this as it keeps the temperatures quite low (just above 30 C in idle, peaks around 75 C during load). Since the temperatures are so low the fans can run very quietly.

<a name="ryzenOC"><sup>1. Re: The Ryzen Overclock</sup></a>
This was a unstable overclock, and I did not actually run the same test. But I ran another one, where it saw a 8.7% performance increase, so this score is the not-overclocked speed (53.33 fps) multiplied by 1.087, which results in ~57.97 fps. This is not accurate and entirely fair, but should give you a ballpark idea of how the 1700X would've performed if I ran it overclocked.
