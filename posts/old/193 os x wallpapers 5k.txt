# Every Default macOS Wallpaper â€“ in Glorious 5K Resolution
https://512pixels.net/projects/default-mac-wallpapers-in-5k/

I love Snow Leopard default wallpaper so I am happy to see this. 

I also have a soft spot for the Mountain Lion wallpaper as my first Mac had that wallpaper (yeah I was late to the party.)

I also like the Mavericks wallpaper, because my first MacBook came with it and it looks very different.
