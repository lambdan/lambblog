# I Switched To Android

Well, never say never folks. It happened. I switched from my beloved iOS to Android. I switched from a iPhone X to a OnePlus 6T. I went from being a pretty hardcore Apple fanatic, to pretty much not caring about them at all.

Why? 

Well, I don't really know why. I got a cheap Android phone to test the waters out, then I got a better/faster phone, and I kinda loved it.
Then I found more things I liked:

- I loved being able to copy files over USB
- Android feels snappier and faster
- Many convenient customizable things, such as what icons to have in the notification menu and customizable gestures to toggle flashlight etc.
- Being able to install the original Flappy Bird APK and play that version, the best version
- Global scrobbling to Last.fm from any media app
- I'm no longer locked in to one vendors taste of devices. I could get a Samsung, I could get a OnePlus, I could get a Xiaomi, and the basic software and all my settings would be the same. I am no longer dependent on Jony Ive's questionable design preferences.
- Can use different web browsers, gallery apps, messaging apps, dialer apps, contacts apps, etc, and make them your default
- Even though it's silly and not very playable, you can run emulators 
- Fast charging! Just plug in for a little while and you get tons of battery.
- If you have rotation lock on, and you turn your screen, you can still rotate the screen temporarily by pressing a little button in the corner
- Spotify and other offline syncing apps are way more reliable, because they don't need the app open to download their stuff
- Everything is more verbose

Things have improved alot on Android since I last used it in 2012. There's the Play Protect thing now on the Play Store. Apps ask you for permission to camera, storage, etc. When you plug in to a computer you need to select everytime that you want file tranfers. Security seems to have just improved alot in general. Although I know it's not at the same level as the iPhone, but it's good enough for me.

There are still some things I dislike and miss from my iPhone, but it's mostly just because I'm not used to how it's done on Android. Things like selecting text and notification settings all in one place, but that's pretty much it. 

Another thing that's nice is that I am free to back over to iOS whenever I want. Since I [migrated out of iCloud](https://lambdan.se/234-migrate-out-of-icloud) I am pretty platform independent. 
So if Apple shocks me and releases a new phone that I really want, I can go back anytime. 

But for now, I really love Android and I wanna keep using it. It's just a breath of fresh air for me. And it's fun to learn new things.
