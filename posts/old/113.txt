# Cortex - one of my favorite podcasts

All week working, I have been listening to [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex). It's starting to become one of my favorite podcasts. 

I am really fascinated by, and interested in CGP Grey's work antics, how he works in blocks, preferring an iPad, listening to the same song over and over again and so on. I am also fascinated by his minimalism and how he tries to have as few distractions as possible doing anything. 
[His videos on YouTube](https://youtube.com/user/CGPGrey), that he is most famous for, aren't that interesting to me, but I still appreciate the work he puts into them. 
He also has a very popular podcast called [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm) but I'm not a fan of that show. I've tried listening to a few episodes but I can't get through them, they simply don't appeal to me. 
What I'm trying to say is that, I'm not a huge fan of his other works, but I am an incredibly big fan of how he does work and talks about it on this podcast. 

Myke is a great co-host as he questions a lot of Grey's decisions and also talks about his own way of doing things. Both complement each other really well, making the show both humorous and interesting. 

Having a favorite episode of a podcast is kinda weird, but one that I did enjoy extra much was [episode 17](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/17) where Grey revealed how he was the first guy in London to get the (at the time) new iPad Pro, and what consequences that had.
