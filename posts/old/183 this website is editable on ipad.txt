# Publishing and Modifying This Blog from an iPad

I got the 10.5" iPad Pro recently. Since it is a "Pro" device, I decided to try doing some work on it and as it turns out I can actually edit and publish to my blog entirely from this iPad, and quite nicely I might add.

# Publishing

For publishing, I use _Byword_ (as I am writing this in, right now) to write the Markdown text.
From there I export to the app _Transmit_, which is basically a FTP/SFTP client and I simply upload the .txt file from _Byword_ to my VPS in the proper folder.

# Modifying code

To edit, I simply use the app _Prompt_ to SSH into my VPS and I can do modify just like I do on the computer. Especially with a hardware keyboard, this is really nice. 
Even key commands like ^D works to log out and such.

I can run _Safari_ and _Prompt_ side-by-side to just enter code in _Prompt_, and then just hit refresh on Safari to see the changes.

To update the code on Github, I could probably use the git command line on my server, but I haven't looked into it. I am sure it is possible though.

It's actually quite nice. I am liking this.

Of course, editing some code over SSH and writing in Markdown are pretty simple tasks.
