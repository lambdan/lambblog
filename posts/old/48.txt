# It all comes around

The first expensive keyboard I ever bought was a __Apple Wired Keyboard__.  

My first mechanical keyboard was a __Das Keyboard Model S Ultimate (MX Blue)__. My second was a Corsair K65 that I sold.  
Then I got a __CM Storm Quickfire TK (MX Brown)__, which I sold recently.  

Then I got a __Apple Wireless Keyboard__. Also a very nice keyboard, except, it's wireless and doesn't work too consistently because of that. Gonna try and sell it.  

Then I got a __IBM Model M (Buckling Spring)__. Very nice keyboard, just one problem: it doesn't have a Windows key, which ironically, is a problem if you run OS X (you have to remap the option key to some awkward place.)  

So I went back to my __Apple Wired Keyboard__. All is fine until I went to play GTA V on PC. As the Alt and "Windows key" on the Apple keyboard are flipped, I use SharpKeys or Auto Hotkey to flip them around. GTA V didnt obey this...  

So I unplugged my Apple keyboard and went back to my __Das Keyboard__.  

Now all is good again... until I'm not happy with this keyboard... again.
