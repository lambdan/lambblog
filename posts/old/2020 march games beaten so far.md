# Games I've Beaten January 2020-March 22 2020

I don't know why I stopped writing "Game Beaten:" posts immediately after beating a game this year, so I'll have to make this post to catch up.


- ? January: Uncharted 1 (PS4)
	- Pretty awful, the sequels are a lot better
- 4 January: Modern Warfare (PS4)
	- Beat the campaign on Veteran and got all the trophies. Probably one of the easier campaigns to clear on Veteran, only the last level gave me lots of trouble.
	- Really fun campaign with amazing graphics in the house storming mission
	- Pretty short
- 5 January: Uncharted 3 (PS4)
	- Combat is awful in these games, and this one has a ton of combat. Enemies are like bullet sponges.
	- Walking through the desert was just... boring
