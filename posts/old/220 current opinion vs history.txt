# current opinion vs history

i started thinking about Breath of the Wild again and went back to read my original review and early impressions. i hate my opinions from then and want to remove them. 

but the preservationist in me wants to keep it, and so i will. 

i think it’s important to keep history intact, but i also think it’s important to let you change your mind. and giving things a second chance. 

something you do once shouldn’t define you for the rest of your life (unless it’s something extremely bad/criminal). 

so please: take everything i’ve ever said with a grain of salt. i tend to change my mind a lot. 
especially my original Breath of the Wild review, i love that game today and i think it’s amazing.
