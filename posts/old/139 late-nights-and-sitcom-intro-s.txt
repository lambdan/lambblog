# Late Nights and Sitcom Intro's

You're tired. You wanna sleep. But you wanna watch some sitcoms before you do to completely dumb down your brain. 

Here are the best sitcoms, rated entirely by their intro. Keep in mind that I haven't seen every sitcom in the world so I haven't been able to rate every single one out there. 

1. **Seinfeld** - because it has no intro and his stand up is usually very tiring
2. **Two And A Half Men** - very monotone and quiet. Soothing. 

Alright those are the only good ones. Now the bad ones, ranked from less bad to worst:

1. **The Big Bang Theory** - too loud and too many rapidly flashing images
2. **That '70s Show** - rock and head banging. Too upbeeat.
3. **Friends** - way too upbeat, loud and awkward
