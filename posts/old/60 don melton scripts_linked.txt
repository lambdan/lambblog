# Don Melton's video_transcoding scripts
https://github.com/donmelton/video_transcoding

These are the scripts I have used to encode all of my DVDs after I have ripped them with MakeMKV. 

I have also encoded some Blu-rays with it, but not many.

I think the file size is good enough and I think the videos still look great after being transcoded.
