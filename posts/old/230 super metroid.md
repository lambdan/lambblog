# Game Beaten: Super Metroid (SNES)

Ah, yet another game to check off of my "games I need to beat before I die"-list.

It was a breeze once I wanted to play it and found a good guide: [Super Metroid 100% walkthrough under 3 hours with no walljumping](https://supermetroidwalkthrough.wordpress.com/). I have saved it offline and might even print a copy of it. 

It was a surprisingly short game. I was expecting it to be much longer. Or maybe the walkthrough was just that good.

Other than that, there's not much to say. I love the music and graphics and all that stuff, it's peak SNES stuff.

I hate the controls, and I always have, and probably always will. Every setup will have compromises.

I'm probably gonna try to do another playthrough some day. Ideally I'd remember every step of the guide so I can beat it on command.

I played it on my Super Nt with a SD2SNES. While I do have a cart of the game, the SD2SNES is just much more convenient. And I can backup my save file! (and I'm gonna do that right now because I just remembered it!)
