# Advent 1315Nordic Drivers for Windows XP 32-bit

I had to google alot to find these, so I have decided to compile and mirror them nicely here:

Package with all the drivers reuploaded here: [My Nextcloud](https://nc.lambdan.se/index.php/s/mNZoGqLgq4QjmYc)

Should that URL stop working just get in touch with me and I'll re-upload it. I have it stored locally.
I don't have the laptop anymore so I can't test if they still work, but I think they should?

- Audio Realtek HDA - run WDM_R274.exe
- Ethernet SiS - use Device Manger and make it look in WinXP2K folder
- VGA SiS Mirage 3 - run Setup.exe, make sure to set resolution to 1280x800 in Display Properties afterwards (it defaults to 1024x768)
- WLAN Realtek RTL8187B - use Device Manager and make it look in Wlan/RTL8187B/WinXP folder. Also remember to activate the WLAN module by pressing Fn + F10. This needs to be done every time you shut down.

Enjoy!
