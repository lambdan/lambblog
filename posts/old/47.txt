# Goldeneye IL Stats

I finally remembered to re-write the [very old script](http://lambdan.se/d/oldGoldeneye.zip) that I used to use for keeping track of how many attempts and how much time I spend on a IL.
My old script was actually one of the very first "big things" that I ever programmed, therefore it was very bad.

- Completely rewritten in Python
  - Old one was Ruby which I don't know anymore. Python I know somewhat.
- Can now import your times from [_The-Elite_](http://the-elite.net)
  - You just enter your username and hit Enter
- No longer needs to be restarted when adding times
  - Old version required you to restart the script when you inputted a new level
- Saves in one single JSON file (except the OBS .txt output.)
  - JSON is easy to open in a editor to manually fix attempts and times if necessary, also makes it easy to port this script to the web.
