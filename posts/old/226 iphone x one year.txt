# iPhone X - One Year Later Review

I said [a year ago](https://lambdan.se/202-iphone-x) that I was gonna do a more in-depth review after I had the phone for a while. Well, a year is quite a while so let’s go.

And well, it’s a good phone. I am very happy with it. It’s so good that the new _iPhone Xs_ is very uninteresting. The _Xr_ is more interesting, but I don’t want that either.

# X Features

The best part about these X-generation phones is the swipe navigation. Swiping to go home, swiping between apps, it is so much better than the old way of clicking the home button. I rarely switched between apps before, but with the swipes I do it all the time.

_Face ID_ has gotten alot better over the year. It is super fast for me.
That is really all I have to say about it. It works 99% of the time for me and it’s really fast. I don’t miss _Touch ID_ anymore.
I did disable the attention aware thing and notification obfuscation. Been very happy with those settings.  

I’ve gotten used to *OLED*. It’s nothing special anymore. I wouldn’t mind if my next phone doesn’t have OLED. It’s nice in theory but in practice it doesn’t make much of a difference. Atleast on the phone. I love my LG OLED TV. 


# Physically

I’ve used the phone with and without a case. I’ve mostly been using it in both the *Apple Silicone Case* and *Apple Leather Case* and both are equally great. I think I slightly prefer the silicone version but they’re not very different. 
Sometimes (like right now) I use it without a case and it feels very fragile and slippery. I honestly kinda hate it but I also hate the bulk of a case. 

There’s no way to win this battle with this phone. 

However, with the new *iPad Pros* being squared off like the old *iPhone 5*-design I have hope that maybe future iPhones will be the same. 
I’ve been really close to buying an *iPhone SE* just because of the form factor. It is so much better to hold. 

To summarize, I am not very happy with how the X feels in your hand. 

I also don’t like it in my pocket. It feels very big, especially with a case on, which makes it uncomfortable sometimes. 

Oh, and the notch? I never think about it or notice it. It’s fine. 

# Performance 

The phone is still really fast. I never feel “ugh, this should be faster.”

Battery has gotten worse over the year naturally, it’s down to 95% on the battery health page but it’s still plenty for me. I put the phone to charge at night with about 20% left usually. And that’s without using _Low Power Mode_. If I used LPM it would probably be alot better.

————————

In summary I am very happy with this phone. It’s been great and I never think “I wish this was better.”

However, it’s the physical aspects I dislike about it. It’s too big and slippery. 

A while ago there was this [iPhone X SE concept](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/25/iphone-se-plus-concept/) and I love it.

I wish that phone will be real someday, because it seems perfect. 

But in the meantime I’ll keep this phone. 

It’s easily the best phone I’ve used so far.
