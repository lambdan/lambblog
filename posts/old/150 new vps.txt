# New VPS

_Update a few hours later:_
I think everything is done now, as far as this website goes atleast. I still have some other pages to set up, but my blog seems to be functioning 100%.

I have gotten a new VPS so lambdan.se might be shaky while I set everything up.

As far as the VPS goes, I've upgraded quite a bit. I've gone from $25/year to $5/month.
My old VPS had: 
- 128 MB Ram
- Intel Xeon E5335 @ 999 MHz
- 5 GB HDD
- Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (and seemingly no way to update as 128 MB RAM was too little apparently)

The new one has:

- 512 MB RAM
- _QEMU Virtual CPU_ at 2.3 GHz (some VM thing I guess)
- 20 GB HDD 
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
