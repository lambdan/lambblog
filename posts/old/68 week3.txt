# Week 3

I turned 20 this week. Other than that, nothing really happened. 

## Hot

- Been using my new iPad. A great device for lazy people. 
- Ate smorgascake on my birthday, and had people over and had coffee with them. 
- Been (re-re-re-re-re-re-re)watching That 70's Show. God I love it. 
- Beat Mega Man 3 for my first time. I kinda like it. For the time being I like it more than MM2, just because the slide move makes the movement a lot more dynamic. 
- Got a [3:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=9Hts98Lc4_U) in Kung Fu! 8th place at the time of writing (8 seconds from WR, which is a lot in this short game). 

## Not

- I can't quit Mario 64, it's like a drug. 
- Been really cold outside (averaging -35 C) 
- Kinda stopped watching the Sopranos. I've moved to a weekly schedule.
