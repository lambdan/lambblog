# Keyboard Collection (Updated: 7 Mar 2018)

Here's my keyboard collection with a few words about each.
I switch keyboard frequently so I won't bother listing here which one I am currently using, as I would have to go in every week and change it. 
If you really wanna know you can ask me on Twitter.

Also back here frequently as I will keep this page updated.

# Currently Owned

## Topre Realforce 88UB
- 2018-
- Honestly, it's very overpriced and overrated
- However, it is probably the best "all-round" keyboard I've used. I can type on it for hours without being annoyed. I can game on it without being annoyed. It's not too quiet, it's not too loud. It's good all around.
- Mostly bought it because a Swedish store had one left with the Swedish layout, so I couldn't resist

## Apple Magic Keyboard 2
- 2017-
- Bought to use with iPad, I keep it in a [Studio Neat Canopy](https://www.studioneat.com/products/canopy)
- Also works with Windows: https://lambdan.se/magic-keyboard-on-pc-20170704-i191

## Fnatic Gear Rush (MX Blue)
- 2017-
- Re-branded Func KB-460. Has backlight, media keys, 2 USB ports and included wrist rest (detachable) - alot for the low price. Feels pretty good too.

## Cherry G84-4100LCM
- 2016-
- Bought it for less than $3. Used it very briefly. Too compact layout.

## IBM Model M
- 2015-
- Bought from the marketplace on Sweclockers. PS/2 connector. My favorite keyboard for typing. Terrible for gaming.

## Apple Wired Keyboard
- 2012-
- My first "expensive" keyboard that I bought with my own money. Actually my second one of these, as I sold the first one, then regretted it and bought another one the week after. 
- It's a very good keyboard, but it's a bit "boring" and some games that use the CAPS LOCK key won't work well.

# Previously Owned

These have been sold, traded, given away or thrown out for various reasons.

- Varmilo VA88M (MX Red)
    - 2017-2018
    - One of the best keyboards I've had, super solid build quality
    - Unfortunately I was very annoyed by the keys not being "sunk in" and it just wasn't a very interesting keyboard, so I sold it

- VORTEX Pok3r RGB (MX Brown)
    - 2017-2018
    - My first 60% keyboard
    - 60% was very annoying for me because as it turns out, I use the function keys (namely F2) and the arrow keys a ton, so I didn't use it alot and sold it

- CM Storm Novatouch
    - 2016-2018
    - I used to love this keyboard but ultimately it felt like a knockoff Topre Realforce, so I sold it
    - Had one of the best spacebars I've ever used - didn't wobble at all

- Tesoro Tizona G2N (Kailh Brown)
	- 2016-2017
	- Worst keyboard I've had
	- The cable I got with it couldn't be connected to it, as the plastic around it was too thick to fit in the hole
	- Had a DC Power input. Why?
	- Once I got it connected to my PC it didn't work in all USB ports either
- Tesoro Durandal G1N (MX Black)
	- 2015-2017
	- A very good keyboard, but looked a bit ugly
- Das Keyboard Model S Ultimate (MX Blue)
	- 2012-2017
	- My first mechanical keyboard
	- Started having issues where it didn't always work after I turned on my computer and required killing all power and waiting a while
- Apple Wireless Keyboard
	- 2015-2016
	- Felt a bit flimsy since it isn't "solid" underneath
- CM Storm QuickFire TK (MX Brown)
	- 2015
	- Interesting layout, but caused problems with games that used both numpad and arrow keys
- Corsair K65 (MX Red)
	- 2014
	- First TKL keyboard
	- Bought it just because I was playing a lot of osu! and wanted MX Red's
	- Sold my Das Keyboard to my cousin once I got this, but ended up trading this keyboard with the Das because I missed it
- Tranfor Keyboard
	- 19XX-201X
	- A very sturdy and heavy keyboard
	- Not sure what switches it used, I remember making a thread on Geekhack or Deksthority about it (can't find the thread anymore)
	- Not sure what happened to the keyboard, I kinda want it again. It might be around here somewhere...
	- Recorded typing sound of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X_YnJwQYgk
- Microsoft Sidewinder X4

	- 20XX-201X
	- Tore up a keycap when playing TD in Warcraft 3, and threw it away after that

	- I destroyed it playing Modern Warfare 2 when I called in a Emergency Airdrop that had amazing drops, but got killed by the enemy team before I could grab them
- Various Logitech Rubber Dome keyboards
	- 20XX-201X
	- I really liked these at the time
