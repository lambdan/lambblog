# Game Beaten: Dark Souls III (PC)

I actually beat this **15 Apr 2017**, but for some reason I forgot to write about it here. Better late than never. 

I generally liked it and had a lot of fun, but I still prefer Bloodborne. 

All the bosses were pretty easy as I recall, except the last two (especially that prince and his brother, really struggled with them.)

But yeah, pretty good game as I recall. The best Dark Souls by far. 

But Bloodborne is better. Why? It has a faster pace and better health recovery system (hitting enemies and just being able to farm potions).
