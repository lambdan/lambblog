# The Emoji for Linked Posts
https://emojipedia.org/round-pushpin/

I have added linked posts functionality to lambblog again.
Look out for this emoji: üìç

I decided to add the functionality again as most of these kind of blogs have the functionality, and I sometimes feel like I need to provide some commentary on some stuff I find online.

I have also added support for it in the [JSON Feed](https://lambdan.se/feed.json) and the [RSS Feed](https://lambdan.se/rss), however, in the RSS feed there is no permalink to my blog, the URLs in there just go to the external URL.
However, in the JSON Feed, linked blogs are natively supported so `url` points to my blog, and `external_url` points to the external URL.

Have fun!
