# Game Beaten: Uncharted 2 (PS4)

- Very frustrating controls. I died a lot from it doing stuff I did not intend to. 
- Good story. I really like Chloe. 
- Pretty mediocre graphics, which makes sense since its a PS3 game (I played on PS4 though)
- Good puzzles

Overall like a 7/10. Good game but nothing spectacular nowadays. Had I played it when it was new I wouldâ€™ve probably been mind blown.
