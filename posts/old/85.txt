# Where's Week X? (Week 13)

What happened to Week 12? Is there gonna be a Week 13?

Short answer: probably not. I stopped writing them because it wasn't fun anymore. When I first started, I wanted to have something always write because I enjoyed writing then. 
And I still enjoy writing but not as much, atleast not Week X. Basically it started to feel like more of a drag than fun. 

I might still do some occasional Week X's, like this week and other weeks if I have something cool to talk about. 

Anyway, here's week 13:

# Week 13

I've been sick

## Hot

- I got another 4 TB HDD for our NAS. Great to not be claustrophobic anymore.
- Been getting into Bloodborne and been enjoying it. In kind of a slow spot right now (Hypogean Gaol) which isn't that fun.
- Almost done with the Sopranos
- Been messing around with different OS'es on a old laptop. Win 98, XP and Vista.
- [/blog is now /](http://lambdan.se/84/blog-is-now-updated)

## Not

- Been sick with a awful cold, cough etc. Nephews gave me the disease.
- Almost lost the Win 10 installation on my main rig after trying to triple-boot Vista. I'm not sure how I fixed it, but it works fine now again.
- My Apple Watch came to a complete halt and I had to force reboot it (hold down the buttons for 10 secs). First time that has happened. Pretty good for over 6 months.

Until next time... Whenever that is. I hope you enjoy the new lambdan.se. The /blog is now / and I think it makes more sense. My old Index did pretty much nothing and no one should've been using it.
