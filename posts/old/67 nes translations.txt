# Swedish translations of NES Games

For some reason I tried a bunch of Swedish translations of NES Games on my Everdrive N8, and decided to take screenshots of some of them.

In that linked Imgur album I go into more detail on the screenshots themselves.

Most of them were made in the 90s it seems. I'm not really sure why though, Swedes are usually pretty good at English, but maybe we were bad back then and needed translations?
