# Can we please talk about that horrid font used in the Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy?

I didn't think much of it at first, but I agree completely. Even I, someone who is not a fan of Crash Bandicoot, knows the font. 

The *Breath of the Wild* example is good too. 

I still haven't gotten this trilogy in case you're wondering, mostly because I am not a Crash fan. But I like the cover art for the physical version, so I'm gonna have to get it at some point. 

There is also a [PS1 Jewel Case version](https://twitter.com/neil_druckmann/status/880995990794194945) apparently - I would love to have it.
