# Refurbishing NES / Famicom controllers in 2013
http://mikejmoffitt.com/wp/?p=201

Been looking around today for something that can fix my worn out NES controllers, and apparently replacement rubber doesn't seem that great as they seem to require modification. 

I will probably end up buying a "new" controller.
