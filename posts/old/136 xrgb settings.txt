# A/D Level
Your A/D level might not be the same as mine. Use the [240p Test Suite](http://junkerhq.net/xrgb/index.php/240p_test_suite) to calibrate it, using *FirebrandX's* instructions: 

> Lastly, it's become quite obvious that each person should ideally calibrate the A/D setting based on their own console for the given profile. The best way to do this is to use Artemio's 240p test suits; specifically the color bars test pattern. So for example on the Super NES, you'd load up the test pattern and adjust A/D until the top two green shades become just distinct from each other. This ensures maximum color range without crushing colors. 

Make sure you do it. I had to crank mine up quite a bit but it made a big difference.
