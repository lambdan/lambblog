# Post from Windows 3.1

This is something I thought I would never do. 

Well I don't think I can publish it from here, but atleast I can write the plain text files.
If I found a sftp client or a ssh client I could publish it from here. 
Taking a screenshot of this would probably be hard to do inside of 3.1 too.

Written with Notepad version 3.1.
