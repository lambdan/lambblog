# How to get audio in Plex Media Player on Raspberry Pi 2

For some dumb reason they still haven't fixed this dumb bug...

- SSH into your Pi. The username is _root_, password is _plex_.
- Do these commands to open up config.txt in nano: `mount -o remount,rw /flash` and `nano /flash/config.txt`
- Go to the bottom of config.txt and add this line: `hdmi_force_edid_audio=1`
- Hit Ctrl X, then Y to save
- Unmount and reboot: `mount -o remount,ro /flash` and `reboot`

(If you have your SD card handy you can also just plug that into your PC and you will find config.txt in the root of it, just add `hdmi_force_edid_audio=1` to the bottom of that and save and it will have the same effect.)

And that's it. Now I get Stereo, AC3 5.1 and DTS 5.1 over optical into my soundbar from my Pi 2 running PMP 1.1.1.

Or you could just use Rasplex instead...

<small>Footnote: for some dumb reason I couldn't use codeblocks. It just refused to, even though the preview in Atom was fine. I'm thinking it's Parsedown's fault.</small>
