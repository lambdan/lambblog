* I am much more impressed by this kind of innovation than anything Apple has done recently
* Each screen is 4K and has GSync. Ridiculous. 
* I don't want one myself. At that weight and bulkyness you might as well get a desktop and separate screens. It's not a laptop.
* This is just a concept and is not in production, but it's still hella innovative
