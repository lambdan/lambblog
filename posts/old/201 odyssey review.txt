# Game Beaten: Super Mario Odyssey (Switch)

![Title](https://lambdan.se/img/ody/2017-10-28%2020-23-18.mkv_snapshot_02.08.44_%5b2017.10.28_22.44.48%5d.jpg)

It's great. It's my 2nd favorite Mario game probably (1st being Mario 64, obviously.)

I don't particularly like the controls. I had some issues doing sideflips and you are forced to use motion controls despite using a Pro Controller, but they're still good.
The movement is kinda interesting though and I have seen some [pretty sick runs](https://twitter.com/Volvagia224/status/924278511166197761) already so I am curious to see how speedruns will play out.

My favorite music track is from [Wooded Kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKBjbjZfTiM).

~~I have no plans to go back and play it or collect more moons (I ended up with 196.), I don't really see a point in getting any more of them - I feel like I've gotten what I wanted.~~ I went back and played some more after sleeping.
And like _Breath of the Wild_ the game has so many collectibles that it's overwhelming and I don't even know where to begin if I would.

You are weird if you have a Switch and don't get this game.
