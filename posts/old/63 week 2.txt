# Week 2

Pretty boring week, but it had some highlights.

Hot:

- Watched an amazing episode of Sopranos. S2E12. 
- Got a good grade on my C++ final 
- Ordered a pre-owned iPad Air 2 64 GB Wifi for $399 (and since my birthday is tomorrow, Monday, my parents sponsored $100 of that, so $299 in total for me)
- Did some changes to the blog, [read about it](http://blog.lambdan.se/61/changes-to-my-blogging-engine) if you haven't 
- [Dipped my toes](https://twitter.com/djs__/status/688701219527856128) into N64 development. Pretty fun. 
- [I beat Super Mario Bros. in under 6 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl7ui3wn_B0). Always wanted to do that.

Not:

- My NAS has only 150 GB left of disk space. Gonna have to order another 4 TB or 6 TB disk soon.
- Been pretty bored with video games this week. They haven't been as fun as they usually are (I did like playing Mario 1 and Mega Man 2 though, probably gonna play more NES stuff when I get the Everdrive.)
