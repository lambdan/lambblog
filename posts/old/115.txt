# We like the 4" iPhones!

By coincidence I happened to see a ad with the most popular phones in Sweden according to Prisjakt (which is a price comparison site, literally Pricehunt) and I found it interesting.

I don't care much about the Android phones, I've never heard of the *HTC 10* for example, but I found the iPhone choices interesting. 

* SE 16 GB is the most popular one, and honestly I don't blame anyone. I want one too. 
* 5S is the 2nd most popular iPhone 

By these two points alone, it would seem that people here want the smaller and cheaper iPhones. 

* 6 16 GB is right after the 5S. This is one of the more surprising ones to me as I would've thought 6S would've been more popular. 
* Then we have the SE 64 GB. 
* And finally we got the the 6S, and it's even the 64 GB model. 

Here are my conclusions:

* Swedes like smaller phones, seeing how *iPhone SE* and *Z5 compact* are dominating the list. 
* Swedes prioritize price (iPhone 6 being more popular than 6S, though 5S isn't more popular than SE, but I think that's because the 5S is simply too old)
* Swedes are ok with 16 GB of storage
* Swedes really don't like the Plus sized iPhone (it doesn't appear until #34, which is the 6S Plus 64 GB)
 
Some things to consider:
* iPhone SE is the newest iPhone. In my experience, the newest iPhone will always be the most popular one. 
* Not everyone uses this price hunting site. I do all the time, but a lot of people don't. 
* A lot of people don't even price hunt their phones as they get their phones from their operators on contracts and such.

Now I want a iPhone SE again. It seems like a beautiful phone.
