# Removal of 3D Touch app switching gesture in iOS 11 confirmed as intentional change

Well I'm glad I didn't get used to it. 
I have done it a couple of times but it always felt weird and sometimes something I didn't intend for happened. 

I'm interested why though. Maybe something to do with the new allegedly edge-to-edge display iPhones later this year? ðŸ¤”
Maybe it feels wrong to press so hard right on the edge of a display with a curved body underneath?

I have no idea really, but I really look forward to seeing the new iPhones.
