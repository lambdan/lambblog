There has been an old ROTJ despecialized verison out forever, but it's quality was pretty bad. Now there's a good one.

The work that Harmy and everyone he gets sources from is just mind blowing. Check out this [introductory guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yLsvexWBVM8IYSGopKuSfsGk5YIgCwQWd23bqb5ryD4/pub) or this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXifjbxZDAM) if you wanna be in awe.

Now I just wait for the The Force Awakens blu-ray.
