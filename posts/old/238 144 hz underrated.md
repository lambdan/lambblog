# 144 Hz is Underrated

I've been messing around with my monitors again, trying to live a One Monitor Life. Mostly just for how clean it looks. In an ideal world my desk would have 3 things: monitor, keyboard and mouse. I will probably never be able to accomplish that, but it's good to have dreams.

So I brought out my _Dell U3417W_ again, which you may know from my [previous adventure](https://lambdan.se/232-no-more-ultrawide). 
Anyway, I hooked it up and used it for a couple of days but something just inherently felt wrong with it.
Yes the picture quality is great, the IPS panel is pretty good on that thing. But everything just felt wrong. I felt nauseous and uncomfortable. Something just isn't right.
While I know it's just a 60 Hz monitor I really didn't think that was the reason why. My phone is 60 Hz, and I never feel that. My TV is 60 Hz (for the most part), and I never feel that. 

But sure enough, that was it. I swapped back to my _Agon AG241QX_ and it just feels so much better. I don't feel nauseous anymore. I am sitting comfortably again. And especially my mouse cursor is so much better to move around. It's insane what a difference it makes.

I almost wanna argue that 144 Hz is more important in Windows than it is in games. Windows just feels so much better. Moving around windows in Windows is much more fluid and just feels better.

For some reason I only have this experience at my desk though. Whenever I use any other device (like I said) or a laptop, it feels fine. 
I think it's because I've used a 144 Hz monitor for so long at my desk that my body just expects that whenever I sit down at my desk, and that's why I get nauseous when the screen isn't at that high of a refresh rate.

Speaking of refresh rates, I don't think 144 Hz is what I actually need. It's somewhere around 120 Hz where I can't tell a difference anymore.

So, what's next for me?

Well, I'm gonna continue try to just use 1 monitor. As I said, it looks so clean with just 1 monitor. Especially coupled with a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse.
I'm pretty sure I'll go back to dual monitors eventually. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe next week. Maybe next month.
