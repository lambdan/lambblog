I cannot believe this image finally has a backstory. I cannot remember when I first saw it because it was a very, very long time ago. 

One nitpick though: I don't think that's a mechanical keyboard which *Kotaku* claims it is. They probably just saw it and assumed all old keyboards are mechanical.
