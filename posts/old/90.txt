# Post-Series Depression
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Post-Series+Depression&defid=6667817

I always knew there was a term for this feeling.

Shows I've felt it for:

- Friends (probably hit me the hardest)
- That 70s Show 
- Orange is the new black (after each season, as you have to wait a year for the next season)
- Mythbusters
- Seinfeld
- Two and a half men (when Charlie left)

I did not really feel it for Sopranos, which is weird, because I really liked that show. I guess it was because I knew what the ending was like so I was just waiting for it.
