# Week 7

"New phone", the eye doctor, and games.

## Hot:

- Visited the eye doctor to get my eyes validated so I can start practice driving (for a drivers license)
- Bought a pre-used iPhone 5s on Ebay, for a very good price (about the price of a pre-owned iPhone 5). Kinda like it, and kinda dislike it in some aspects. Gonna try using it for a week and see how it goes.
- Bought the Black Ops III Starter Pack on Steam and been enjoying multiplayer alot in it
- Watched Straight Outta Compton, great movie. Also watched Mad Max Fury Road, did not enjoy it as much.

## Not:

- Street Fighter V is hard
- Spent alot of money
