# Game Beaten: Super Mario RPG (SNES)

Another one to check of my "games to beat before I die"-list. 

You can watch my playthrough here:

I used this walkthrough: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588739-super-mario-rpg-legend-of-the-seven-stars/faqs/8365 -- it was good for the most part, but there were some inaccuracies and some unclear parts and sometimes it was routed weirdly where you had to go back all of a sudden. But overall, very good and made it a breeze to go through the game.

So what do I think of this game? 

Pros: 

+ Funny and quirky
+ Surprises and plot twists
+ Bright, pretty graphics
+ Soundtrack
+ Combat keeps you active 
+ Easy

Cons:

- Platforming, controls felt slippery and sometimes it was hard to jump at the proper angle

Overall, there was just something that left me feeling a bit empty. Maybe it should've been a bit longer. I've gone back and done some more exploring and optional stuff but there's still something missing I feel. 
But still, I am very happy and proud to have played through the game. I'm working through the SNES RPGs.
