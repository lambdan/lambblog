# HL2 EP2

I cannot believe they left it like this.

I think it's worse than _The Sopranos_ ending. 

I mean, I've known about how EP2 ended for years, since the game was new basically. I saw my friend and brother play through it when the game was new and relevant.

But experiencing it now for myself? I am pissed off. What the hell happened?

Apart from that, I didn't really like the gameplay of EP2 as much as EP1 (or HL2). There was alot of waiting and defending and story. EP1 was really fast paced which I loved. But it was nice to see the forest environment I guess. 

But god damn, where is EP3?
