# Movies I Watched in 2019

Here we are again. I feel like it was just the beginning of 2019 and I started taking notes, thinking it's gonna be forever until I can compile them and publish this. But here we are.

2019 was a great year for movies and me. I watched alot of them, mostly due to watching the MCU. I have a feeling there's gonna be less next year because I won't have the entire MCU to catch up on.

New this year is that I'll have a little section for "end of year" notes, called **Retrospective Thoughts**, which is what I think about the movies in retrospect. I'm gonna write them without looking at what I wrote before to avoid influencing myself. So there might be some contradictions, that could be fun.

Here we go!

# Speed (1994) 
Watched: Jan 2

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/speed.jpg)

Sandra Bullock was cute, although she had an extremely annoying voice. In her modern movies she's much cooler.  

But I really didn't like Keanu Reeves. His scratchy voice and bad assery was just yuck...

Nice to know the origin of all these bomb on the bus references, and the _GTA Vice City_ mission where you drive Love Fist around with a bomb in the car.

The bad guy was good. Movie should’ve ended 20 minutes earlier because the ending was dragged out. The decapitation was cool I guess.

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I have kind of forgotten about Speed 1.

<br><br><br>

# Bird Box (2018)
Watched: Jan 3

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/birdbox.jpg)

Watched for the memes and more Sandra Bullock. I didn't really like watching it. It was very slow at times and just dragged on, it's just 2 hours but it felt longer than a day of work when I watched it. 

I liked all the clever stuff they did while blind (driving using proximity sensors etc). But ultimately I didn't really care for most of the characters. They should've focused more on the survival. 

And they shouldn't have let the weird guy into the house. And I really hated at the very end where she is apologizing to the little girl, just end it already.

But, the scene where she had waited 15 mins was really sad :'( 

The end was kind of predictable. I thought about blind people very early on and wondered what happened to them.

Ultimately, not a great movie but it's worth watching.

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I've been wanting to back and watch it again to see if it really was that bad, but I haven't yet.

<br><br><br>

# A Quiet Place (2018)
Watched: Jan 4

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/aqp.jpg)

Coming off Bird Box, I wanted to see more like it. I think A Quiet Place is better.
It's just a really interesting idea I thought, however, not really executed to 100%. Surely they could've whispered if they closed all the doors. Just the clinging from forks and water splashing would be louder than a whisper.

It was abit hard to shake Jim Halpert, but once I did I really got into the movie and really felt sad and pain at times, especially with the big yell :'(

I really liked Emily Blunt's performance, especially the bath tub scene and the nail in the stairs, those are probably gonna stick around for a while.

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Oh man I still remember all of Emily Blunt's scenes very vividly. She was fantastic in this movie.

<br><br><br>

# Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997)
Watched: Jan 5

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/speed2.jpg)

I went into this with very low expectations because I saw it's low score on IMDB and everywhere else, but I found it to be a very funny movie. 

Sandra Bullock's acting was hysterically funny, like she was completely out of place and didn't know what she was doing. I feel like if it wasn't her she would've gotten kicked off the set. And her voice was even more annoying in this movie than the first one.

Willem Dafoe's character could be interesting, but I think they made him way, waaaaaaaaaaaay, too ridiculous.

In a way I felt like the movie had no main character, because the hero was so uninteresting. I guess Annie is the main character but towards the end when she was on the scooter with the bad guy you could almost forget about her.

I liked it more than the first one in some ways, mostly because of no Keanu Reeves, but ultimately this movie is so bad that it's good.

Oh and I got a poster for it on my wall. 

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Ah yes, Speed 2. I think about this movie almost daily because I have a poster of it on my wall. I've tried to re-watch it, but I just can't. It's a truly terrible movie.

<br><br><br>

# The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005)
Watched: Jan 6

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/40yov.jpg)

Very funny for the most part. Steve Carell is amazing, and so is Paul Rudd and the other guys. I was laughing out loud several times, especially for the waxing.

Catherine Keener ís super cute. I knew I recognized her from somewhere and sure enough she was Nina in Seinfeld. 

The ending was a bit too dragged out and lovey dovey and cheesy, but alright. It's a sweet movie, with cursing.

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Don't remember much about this movie apart from it being funny.

<br><br><br>

# We're The Millers (2013)
Watched: Jan 6

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/wtm.jpg)

Came for Jennifer Aniston, stayed for Jennifer Aniston. If it wasn't for her I probably would never watch it, or even know about it. 

Overall it was OK. Not that funny, but not that boring either. Seeing Nick Offerman is always cool. 

I really couldn't buy Ed Helms as a druglord. I just don't like Ed Helms I think, not a fan of him in _The Office_ either.

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I only remember that strip club scene. Hmm.

<br><br><br>

# Men In Black (1997)
Watched: Jan 6

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/mib.jpg)

This is not my kind of movie. It had some fun bits in it, and looked good (good 4K restoration) but it's not my kind of movie. And it had no redeeming factors for me. 

Only thing I really liked was when he fired that tiny gun and he flew back. 

5/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I really can't remember anything. 

<br><br><br>

# Enough Said (2013)
Watched: Jan 6

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/es.jpg)

This was on my to-watch list for a long time, ever since I saw Seinfeld, and then later Sopranos, as both _Julia Louis-Dreyfus_ and _James Gandolfini_ are the stars of this movie. 
And then after I saw The 40 Year Old Virgin and wanted to see more _Catherine Keener_, and saw that she was in this movie it was the last straw. 

Not really my kind of movie, but it was OK. Interesting to see Gandolfini not being a mafia boss. I remember there was alot being said about him around the time this movie came out as he died the same year.  

Catherine was very uninteresting though in this movie, so meh, didn't get what I wanted. She was boring, compared to 40 Year Old Virgin where she was fun. 

Story felt pretty real. Really awkward position to be put in. I'd be torn too probably. 

One minor thing I didn't like was that Albert's daughter and Eva's daughter looked very similar, both had black short hair. Kinda confusing.

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I do not look back on this movie fondly. I don't remember it being good.

<br><br><br>

# The Proposal (2009)
Watched: Jan 7

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/tp.jpg)

It was pretty much what I expected. Actually kinda pleasant to watch up until the end, it was kinda amusing and cute and so on.

I liked the Speed 2 scene though, where Annie, err Margaret, drove the boat really fast, and then fell off and had to be rescued outta the water. During the closing credits they asked her if she was a good driver, so that's nice, references are nice.

But the ending fell apart really fast. And yeah I know it's a romantic comedy and everything works out but just blehhhhh.

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Turned out to be Ryan Reynolds best movie for me this year. I could rewatch it.

<br><br><br>

# Deadpool (2016)
Watched: Jan 7

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/dp.jpg)

I liked it, time flew by. 

I did not really like the "flashback" scenes or what you wanna call it, but I did like all the "superhero" scenes.

All the sarcasm jokes and 4th wall breaking was kinda corny, but it was somewhat amusing. I guess its part of what makes Deadpool Deadpool.

Left me feeling optimistic for Deadpool 2.

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Can't really remember anything.

<br><br><br>

# The Net (1995)
Watched: Jan 8

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/net.jpg)

I like Sandra Bullock, I like computers, it was referenced in Seinfeld... how bad could it be? 

Yeah it's pretty bad.

I can't be too hard on this movie because it's from 1995 and computers were wild but WOW I really didn't like this movie. Just the whole premise, and "action" and "drama", I was just facepalming at everything and saw everything coming from a mile, no hundreds of miles, away.

There are some things I like though. 
First off, all the old computers (modern at the time) were fun to see. 
Secondly, I liked that it was a female computer genius. 
Thirdly, I guess the last 20 minutes or so were kind of fun, with the sneaking in thing and hacking the thing, and sending the files to the FBI. It wasn't a nailbiter, which I appreciate.

Her mother not remembering her was kind of sad, but ehh, just an unbelievable movie as a whole. 

And I couldn't really see Sandra Bullock as a computer hacker. She fit in as well as the computer expert in stock photos do.

As Frank Costanza said, it's a provocative movie.

5/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Ah yes, The Net. Another movie that I have poster of on my wall. I kinda like this movie in retrospect, and I would like to rewatch it. I think it might be good.

<br><br><br>

# Deadpool 2 (2018)
Watched: Jan 10

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/dp2.jpg)

"Left me feeling optimistic for Deadpool 2"... that sentence did not age well.

I really hated that kid Russell. Just about everything annoyed me about him, especially how he spoke.

All the sarcasm and jokes and 4th wall breaking was still amusing but the kid ruined it overall.

The Super Duper Cut should've cut out all the scenes with him and all the prison stuff... you wouldn't be left with much then though. I guess that could really be a Super Duper cut.

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

All I remember is that damn annoying kid. Really didn't like this movie.

<br><br><br>

# The House (2017)
Watched: Jan 12

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/house.jpg)

I wanted to see Amy Poehler in a movie. 

It was very mediocre, below average. There was some funny stuff, like with the axe, but overall it was just not entertaining. 

4/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I have completely forgotten about this one.

<br><br><br>

# Pixels (2015)
Watched: Jan 13

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/pixels.jpg)

Here's a movie I'm not allowed to like, but I loved it! It was funny and time just flew by. I had a chuckle every couple of minutes.

The special effects were cool and it looked awesome on my OLED TV in HDR mode. Very neat seeing game characters in "real life". I especially enjoyed Donkey Kong, with how the level was laid out. And Pac-Man munching through New York was almost frightening.

Only part that felt slow was the tuxedo party scene. It would've been almost a perfect movie if it just went from battle to battle to battle.

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I remember this movie being fun. I could rewatch it. 

<br><br><br>

# Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)
Watched: Jan 18

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/kb1.jpg)

The best anime I've ever seen, and it's not even anime!

Beautiful imagery. Even though I just watched regular 1080p BluRay, it looked better than most 4K HDR movies I've seen. Just beautiful vivid colors and blacks.

The music was fantastic as well. I am nostalgic for the "Woo Hoo" song because I heard it alot back in '04 or so, and I knew it came from Kill Bill, but I was not allowed to watch it so I had no idea really. But yeah the soundtrack is really great, maybe one of my favorites.

Just a really great, artistic and aesthetic movie. I really liked pretty much everything about it. It's just a damn cool first half of a movie. Music is so nice too. 

9/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Oh man, Kill Bill. I wanna rewatch it, and I have! F***ing awesome movie(s). (Cont'd in Kill Bill 2)

<br><br><br>

# Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)
Watched: Jan 18

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/kb2.jpg)

I really enjoyed her getting shot with a shotgun as soon as she opened the door and flew way back, that was hillarious and I was not expecting it. I also enjoyed finally seeing the "buried alive" sequence since I always wanted to see that since watching the Mythbusters episode about it. I really enjoyed the fight with Elle, with the eye. I really liked the hotel room shootout with the hole in the door. I liked that she got re-united with her kid.

But other than that, I did not like this as much as the first half. I really liked all the action in the first half, this second half was more story, which I also like. I liked the story of her finding her daughter again etc.

I still appreciate all the music and aesthetic parts. It's just a very nice movie, just like the first half.

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I feel so heartwarmed by how it ended with the daughter and all. Really fantastic movie(s). I almost get emotional thinking about them. The music was so freaking good too, I have listened to it throughout the year.

<br><br><br>

# Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)
Watched: Feb 22

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/smsv.jpg)

I was going into this with very high expectations. I liked Spider-Man Homecoming and I loved the 2018 PS4 game, and this movie got high ratings and I constantly saw on Twitter how people were raving about it.

But... I am pretty disappointed. I just didn't like it. It looked cool at first but it didn't take long until I started to constantly check the time to see how much was left. In fact, I was so bored by it that I started writing down some notes to discuss:

- That anime chick is clearly a Overwatch D. Va rip off
- The music choices are not very good. It's not my kind of music, except for Hypnotize, that's a pretty good song. Sunflower is good too.
- The animation was very choppy and it really bothered me. I know it was their artistic choice, but I was just annoyed by it. Just made me wonder if something was wrong with my TV or the audio sync. I even tried turning on TruMotion to see if it could smooth it out, but nope.
- Apart from the anime girl, I did really like the alternative Spider-Men, especially the noir and the pig. Clever.
- The "My name is X and I was bitten by a radioactive spider..." parts got pretty boring and repetitive after a while.

After I had watched the movie I saw a review for it in Plex on my TV, and I think one of them summarized it perfectly: "It is more an experiment than an actual film."

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I feel like I misunderstood this movie and need to rewatch it. I still glimpse through it here and there to demonstrate my OLED TV to people. It's so vivid with color.

<br><br><br>

# Titanic (1943)
Watched: Mar 10

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/titanic.jpg)

I was on a Titanic kick after having watched the good 1997 version with my nephews who saw it for the first time, so I read the whole Wikipedia article about the ship and stumbled upon this movie.

I dunno, it's what it is. I did enjoy the scene though where the guy tries to solve a math problem to get a kiss though, I found it hillarious.

5/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Really can't remember much about it other than being made by nazis. 

<br><br><br>

# Leaving Neverland (2019)
Watched: Mar 12

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/ln.jpg)

(I'm counting this as a movie. It was released at a film festival.)

I don't really wanna make any comment on what I think of MJ, but, yeah, it's really messed up. I don't really see any reason why you would doubt their stories. I think it's just a matter of time until more stories come out if these are true.

The documentary itself had nice archive footage I thought, but maybe a bit too much drone footage. And the stories came outta nowhere and really shocked me. 
I couldn't just sit and watch the whole thing 100% focused though, because some of the interviews were just too slow (which is totally understandable) so this is definetely a have on in the background and play with your phone kind of deal.

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Oh yeah... I put this in here. Maybe that was a mistake. Well, whatever. I've kinda forgotten about their stories, and since the movie came out haven't there been documents proving this couldn't have happened or something? I don't know. I just don't care. I hope MJ didn't do it but maybe he did.

<br><br><br>

# RoboCop (1987)
Watched: Mar 16

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/rc.jpg)

This movie is awesome. 
I loved when the demo failed and the robot loaded his body full of bullets. I also liked when the bad guys shot Murphy full of bullets.
Seeing Kurtwood Smith, after only seeing him in _That '70s Show_, as a bad ass was shocking and really awesome. I loved him cursing and being a bad mother****er.
I loved how they showed the POV from Murphy/Robocop as he was transformed.
I loved Robocop solving crime, stopping the robbery and the rape. Such a badass.
The guy who had been through the toxic waste looked truly disgusting.

Only things I can complain about are the horrible stopmotion effects for the big robot, they reminded me of Terminator 1.
And the green screen at the very end when Dick falls out the window was really, really, really bad.

But other than that, hell yeah it's an awesome movie, and it's fun too.

9/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I forgot to watch the sequel. I remember this being a fun and good movie.

<br><br><br>

# Blockers (2018)
Watched: Mar 30

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/blockers.jpg)

I had a few loud laughs here and there, but overall very meh. 
It had some fun, it had some heartfelt moments, it had some stupid parts. 

4/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Can't remember this one either. I think I might mistake it for _The House_.

<br><br><br>

# Iron Man (2008)
Watched: Apr 6

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/ironman.jpg)

The first 25 minutes or so are pretty bad but after that I really enjoyed it. 
A bit too many plot twists that could be predicted, but that's ok, all movies have them. 

The computers Stark designed his suit on were really cool. Would be neat if we got those. 

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Ah, the first MCU movie. I've been meaning to rewatch some of them and this could be one of them. I basically only remember the cave scenes.

<br><br><br>

# The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Watched: Apr 6

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/hulk.jpg)

The first half or so was boring and lame, kind of a snoozer. The second half was very ridiculous and over the top and gave me _Speed 2_ vibes, which was very entertaining to watch.

Time flew by, but that first half was really lame. And Betty really bothered me for some reason.

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I only remember the part where he is in the glass bridge between buildings or whatever and the windows break.

<br><br><br>

# Iron Man 2 (2010)
Watched: Apr 7

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/ironman2.jpg)

The russian guy was annoying and stereotypical. Justin Hammer was really annoying. The end war started off really good but it got resolved too easily. I wanted a long fight with the Russian guy but they got rid of him too easily.

I was really expecting Natalie to be a backstabber, but nope, she was good, so that was a pleasant surprise. Would've been an easy plot twist.

But time flew by and for a lot of the time I liked this more than the first one, but the end was kind of a let down and I was more annoyed overall. Elon Musk really didn't have to be in it. 

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Was this the one Elon Musk was in?

<br><br><br>

# Thor (2011)
Watched: Apr 13

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/thor.jpg)

I really hated the beginning. I can't stand medieval times with swords and dragons and stuff. But once I got past that I really liked it, and for some reason I got really into it.

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I think the only part I remember is Natalie Portman and Thor hugging it out under a laser beam or something.

<br><br><br>

# Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
Watched: Apr 13

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/ca.jpg)

Probably the worst war movie I've seen. It was just so boring and bland. Barely felt like a superhero movie. 

Sad about Peggy though... that's like the only thing I can remember from this movie, the sacrifice.

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I should probably rewatch this one as I ended up liking Captain America. Only thing I remember is the crash.

<br><br><br>

# The Avengers (2012)
Watched: Apr 14

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/avengers.jpg)

That was awesome. Those two hours just flew by. Confirmed to me that it was worth watching the prior movies.

Only thing I wanna complain about is that the Hulk was really ugly for some reason. He just looked off. 

Tony Stark was charming as always.

Also one of the most beautiful movies I've seen on my OLED TV. It was very colorful and vivid. Also neat that it was in the 1.85 aspect ratio.

9/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Actually can't remember anything. I think this is the one Iron Man goes through the hole and out into space and then barely makes it back? Could do a rewatch.

<br><br><br>

# Iron Man 3 (2013)
Watched: Apr 18

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/ironman3.jpg)

It was a bit off the rails and ridiculous, but I still enjoyed it alot. I wish they'd done more with Pepper being juiced up, that could've been interesting. 

I really enjoyed Tony Stark so I am sad that the Iron Man trilogy is over. Will look forward to seeing him in the Avengers movies and whatever else MCU movies he's in.

9/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I only remember it being snowy in this movie. 

<br><br><br>

# Thor: The Dark World (2013)
Watched: Apr 21

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/thor2_c.jpg)

This movie felt stupid. It had alot of stupid jokes and just everything was stupid. Why did Selvig have to be in his underwear? 
Thor hanging his hammer in the apartment though, that was funny.

I did like Loki in this movie though, I liked him as a prisoner.

I just have something against Thor in general, I can't take him seriously. His stupid hammer bonking everything, his stupid blue eyes, his way of speaking. He's just stupid. I liked him in Avengers, but his own movies are so far really dumb.

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I remember this movie being terrible.

<br><br><br>

# A Star Is Born (2018)
Watched: Apr 22

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/asib.jpg)

Now for something different from the MCU movies...

So I heard _Shallow_ on the radio, and in Spotify, so I should figured I should watch the movie it's from. 
Romance Musicals (is that the genre?) isn't really my thing, like at all, but I figured I can just stop if I don't like it.

But no, I liked the build up to Shallow, and actually seeing it live, but then after that I lost interest pretty fast. 
But since I was 40 minutes into the movie I figured I'd rather watch the rest of it so I can say I watched it, rather than stopping there and having wasted 40 mins of my life.

The latter half of the movie just feels so rushed and fast. It's like BOOM they got married, BOOM Ally got a manager, BOOM Ally got a album, BOOM Ally got a grammy, BOOM Jack commited suicide, and I felt no sadness about that because I really didn't like Jack, he was just so sleezy and talked so annoyingly. And he crashed her Grammy stage, that was really hard to watch. 

But I did really enjoy Lady Gaga as an actress though, I hope she does more. I thought she was great.

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Maybe the most overrated movie I saw this year? It was really good until Lady Gaga did Shallow up on the stage, and after that it just went downhill.

<br><br><br>

# Captain America: The Winter Solider (2014)
Watched: Apr 22

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/ca2.jpg)

And now back to the MCU...

I really disliked the first Captain America movie, so I did not look forward to this one, but I should've been. This movie was awesome, and Captain America is far from my least favorite avenger now. 

I just got hooked immediately. I loved the story, all the characters (literally of them: Steve, Nick Fury, Natasha and Falcon). I really got into Steve and Natasha, I would like to see them more together.

I also liked the look of the movie. It looked very fresh and was pleasant to look at, it was bright and nicely lit.

It was funny ("on your left"), had some heartfelt scenes (old Peggy) and action (Falcon escaping the crashing building). It was just fantastic and time flew by. 

Only thing I can kinda complain about is Bucky, he felt kinda shoehorned in. He didn't need to be there... but maybe he was there in the original comics or something, I don't know. I didn't like that Cap tried to save him.

But despite that: my favorite MCU movie so far.

9/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I have rewatched this already and I could do it again. I love this movie still. Maybe my favorite MCU. I have a poster of it on my wall.

<br><br><br>

# Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)
Watched: Apr 23

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/gotg.jpg)

I did not expect to run into Bradley Cooper again. I really liked Rocket so when I looked up on IMDB to see who he was voiced by I was very surprised. I've never heard of this guy before and now I've seen him in movies for two days (_A Star Is Born_.) I liked him alot better as Rocket.

As for the movie itself, it was great. One of the most jokey ones (because of Chris Pratt), but at the same time one of the more sad ones so far I think. I didn't really get super into any character, except Groot and Gamora. I really didn't care for Peter that much.

I did not really care for all the different kinds of aliens being around, they were distracting if anything. I think that's why I liked _The Winter Soldier_ so much, it felt somewhat real. _GotG_ is just out of this world.

Eitherway, time flew by and that's how I know it's a good movie. 

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I mean, I remember the characters but I can't really remember anything else. I think "We Are Groot" was in this one.

<br><br><br>

# Arctic (2018)
Watched: Apr 26

Kind of boring movie to be honest, time didn't fly by, but at the same time I sat glued to the TV so I don't know. It was alright, but I probably won't rewatch it. 

The ending was very unsatisfying, reduced my score by 1 just for that. Would be a solid 7 otherwise. 

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I remember it being pretty good. I think I've recommended some people to watch it.

# Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Watched: Apr 27

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/avengers2.jpg)

Something is off with this movie but I can't put my finger on what. Maybe it was just me that wasn't feeling it. Could also be that I went into it with super high expectations since I liked the first _Avengers_ so much.

Ultron was very uninteresting and wasn't very intimidating. Interesting that the _lizard king_ voiced him though, I knew there was something familiar with him.

The twins were just kind of boring and talked weird, and acted awkwardly.

I did not like Nat being with Bruce (see _The Winter Solider_ for what I prefer.)

I also felt like it had a lot of dumb one liners, like "is that the best you can do? -you had to ask". I know these movies have them, and I enjoy them in the other movies but in this one it just felt like there was too many and they didn't feel natural.

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I remember this one being very bad but I think that was maybe an unpopular opinion? Whatever.

<br><br><br>

# Ant-Man (2015)
Watched: May 5

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/antman.jpg)

Did not go into with high hopes but I loved it. Time flew by and it was funny. The heist was cool. The ants were cool. Enlarged _Thomas the Tank Engine_ was cool. 

Also enjoyed seeing _Judy Greer_ in a movie for once. I've only seen her in _Two and a Half Men_ and _The Big Bang Theory_.

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I love Ant-man. Can't remember much though.

<br><br><br>

# Shallow Hal (2001)
Watched: May 9

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/sh.jpg)

Watched because the guys on _Seincast_ mentioned it because _Jason Alexander_ is in it. And since I like _Gwyneth Paltrow_ from watching _Iron Man_ I figured I'd give it a shot.

Unfortunately it's a pretty terrible movie. I had some, maybe even a lot, of laughs and I was kind of intrigued by the idea, but it fell apart pretty fast and pretty unsatisfactory.

_Jason_ was full in full _George Costanza_ mode so he was very enjoyable. 

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Ah this was a fun one. Could do a casual rewatch some day.

<br><br><br>

# Pokémon Detective Pikachu (2019)
Watched: May 14

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/detpik.jpg)

Went into this with extremely high expectations because I thought the idea sounded fantastic, and I still think it is an fantastic idea, but the movie felt kinda lame at times. I just didn't like all the lame sad scenes. Especially the end, I would’ve preferred Detective Pikachu to stay Detective Pikachu, not Ryan Reynolds. 

But all the humor, all the coffee drinking and all the psyduck was awesome. And Pikachu was adorable. In fact, all the Pokémon looked great!

Sign me up for a sequel!

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I tried rewatching it when the Blu-rays were out but I couldn't get through it. I was really bored by it. 

<br><br><br>

# Captain America: Civil War (2016)
Watched: June 2

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/civwar.jpg)

Very boring and mediocre at first, but once Tony met Marisa Tomei and Spider-Man it got all better and I was into it. 
Everything that happened after that was great too, atleast to watch... I don't know how much sense it made from a story standpoint. 

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I only remember this one because it's the one Marisa Tomei makes her first appearance in. 

<br><br><br>

# From Russia With Love (1963)
Watched: June 12

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/frwl.jpg)

I actually tought I had seen this but once I started I realized I hadn't, and I remember why! We had the entire set of James Bond movies on DVD up to circa 2007... except this one - the disc was missing.

Anyway, great movie! I loved the long scene with Bond and the bad guy in the cabin, I couldn't look away. Exploding lake was Die Hard-esque... even though this movie is almost 30 years older than Die Hard.

9/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I watched this on one of my first vacation days and I remember going outside in the middle of it to smoke a cigarette I had bought as "celebration", and this was new for me because I only ever smoked with company or when fishing, I had never done it at home. And I remember not liking it because it felt so uncomfortable. But it's a fun memory I suppose.

<br><br><br>

# Murder Mystery (2019)
Watched: June 19

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/mumy.jpg)

This might be the closest thing we have for a spiritual successor to Speed 2... It’s pretty awful, and Jennifer Aniston’s acting reminds me of Sandra Bullock in Speed 2: she’s out of her mind and acting hysterical, but she looks pretty. 

There was just no satisfaction to be had. And the ending is very rushed. 

5/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I only remember Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler being in this one, but other than that, I don't remember anything.

<br><br><br>

# Doctor Strange (2016)
Watched: July 7

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/ds.jpg)

If it wasn't for the Marvel logo at the beginning, the mention of the Avengers in the middle, and the end scene with Thor I wouldn't have known this was a MCU movie. 

Did not like it. 

5/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

This one I really need to rewatch. I remember being very out of it the day I watched it so I really couldn't care for it. It's on top of my rewatch list.

<br><br><br>

# Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)
Watched: July 9

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/gotg2.jpg)

I really didn't care for the main story of Quill's dad, he just seemed insane, but apart from that I really liked it. I think the first one was slightly better though if you wanna compare them.

There was alot of jokes and references, but they were alright, they suit the film.

The UHD Bluray in HDR looked amazing on my OLED TV. So many bright and vivid colors, especially towards the end.

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I can't remember a damn thing.

<br><br><br>

# Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)
Watched: July 9

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/homecoming.jpg)

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on David, you lost your god damn mind. You watched this movie last year!!

And yes, I did. But I knew nothing of the MCU back then. I don't even think I knew what the Avengers was. 

So I was wondering how I'd do this. Would I just skip this movie and try to remember it, or would I rewatch it? Well, the answer was pretty clear, because I loved this movie without knowing about the MCU, so I imagine how much I loved it now that I know the MCU!

No, but really, I love this movie. It is just so funny. The whole thing with Peter knocking on Liz' door and he's just stunned, just that whole section is hillarious. 

Having seen the previous MCU movies made it alot better too. Now I knew who Tony Stark was! And Happy! 

9/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

So yes, maybe a bit controversial to include this here since I had it in 2018 also, but if you read my reasoning above I'm sure it makes sense. I still love the movie anyway.

<br><br><br>

# Thor: Ragnarok (2017)
Watched: July 10

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/thor_ragnarok.jpg)

Without a doubt the best Thor movie, I was hooked. I still can't stand Loki though, I just want him permanently dead and gone.

And where do I know Cate Blanchett from? She looked so familiar. Did not really like her performance though, nothing outstanding about it. She was just kinda there in the background, being a goth bad girl.

Korg, the rock man, was awesome though. Positive vibes from him.

Beauttiful visuals and all that, especially in 4K/HDR/OLED, as usual. All those teleport scenes where they go through that rainbow blaster must be a ton of bitrate.

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I remember this being good but I see people rave about it like it's the best MCU and I really don't get that.

<br><br><br>

# Black Panther (2018)
Watched: July 11

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/blackpanther.jpg)

This is a solid, right in the middle MCU movie. I went into it with super high expectations because everyone raved about it when it was new, but I am not that impressed by it. 

What I am impressed by though is the amazing visuals of it. I know I say it almost every movie I watch, but this is definitively the prettiest movie I have seen so far on my 4K/OLED/HDR TV. It's just so bright, beautiful saturated clothes, the flames, and it's one of the few MCU movies to be in actual 4K. It's just incredible to watch on this TV.

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I remember it being decent.

# Only You (1994)
Watched: July 11

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/only_you.jpg)

George watches this movie in _Seinfeld S07E14 - The Cadillac_, a.k.a. the Marisa Tomei episode, and it got on my mind recently after watching _Spider-Man Homecoming_, because that's another Marisa Tomei episode, as Susan says.

Anyway, so it's a warm July night, circa 3:30 am, I am trying to fall asleep. I cannot. There are like 5 mosquitoes in my room buzzing around. I try to fall asleep until about 5:30 am when I give up. So I put this movie on, just to have it on in the background and hopefully fall asleep to it. 

But nah, I got hooked. This is a lovely little movie. It was surprisingly funny, had a twist I did not see coming, and a few more twists you could've predicted a mile away. 

Also surprising to me was that _Robert Downey Jr._, a.k.a. _Tony Stark_ was in here too. Knowing that makes the scenes in _Civil War_ much funnier.

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I have fond memories of this movie because I watched it early morning after a night of no sleep. I loved it. I could rewatch it.

<br><br><br>

# My Cousin Vinny (1992)
Watched: July 11

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/vinny.jpg)

Figured I'd watch this too so I have both of the *George Costanza x Marisa Tomei* movies watched.

I did not expect this movie to be as funny as it was. I laughed out loud several times.

I also know _Marisa Tomei_ won an Oscar for this movie, which I find very surprising. She wasn't bad or anything, but she didn't do much... but the Oscar she won was for supporting actress so I guess that makes sense. 

9/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I've rewatched it with my brother and he liked it too so I am happy about that. Also got a poster of it on my wall.

# Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
Watched: July 11

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/infwar.jpg)

This is just... wow. I don't really know what else to say. It's just extremely epic and really brings the previous movies together.

Unfortunately it's one of the most sad ones too, so I'm a bit hesitant to give it a 10. I try to give 10's to movies I can rewatch anytime, like Die Hard. This one might just be a bit too much to swallow again.

I'm just kind of speechless... Thor slamming down into the battlefield with his new hammer was just so amazing that I teared up... Gamora... Groot providing the handle... 

10/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Epic movie. Seeing it the first time was amazing. I call it movie of the decade.

<br><br><br>

# Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018)
Watched: July 12

![Still Frame](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/antman2.jpg)

Everything kinda goes too well in this movie, there's not really too much suspense, but that's nice after seeing _Infinity War_. 

Did not really care for Ava, she was just being annoying. Nice she got healed though, not sure what she ended up doing afterwards.

Truth serum was cool. 

I really Ant-man overall though, just as a concept. I feel like it could happen, someone shrinking back and forth. And it would be super cool if we could just shrink our homes down and take them with us. I might actually go on vacation then.

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Can't remember anything.

# Apollo 11 (2019)
Watched: July 19

![Still](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/apollo11.jpg)

The moon landing and all is amazing, but what I'm really amazed by is this clean footage from the '60s. I love restoration and I am always happy to see them (which is why I like the original Star Wars so much too.)

Hope they make a 4K HDR BluRay of this. I feel like it has to happen since they scanned the reels at 8K and 16K. 

One pretty big complaint I have is that the font they used for almost everything, especially the credits, was extremely tiny. 

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Feels kind of weird to include it here as it feels more like a documentary in retrospect, but alright.

<br><br><br>

# Captain Marvel (2019)
Watched: July 21

![Still](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/cm.jpg)

It was cool to learn some more back story about Nick Fury but other than that, this was extremely mediocre. 

I didn't like the forced nostalgia either, with the Blockbuster and Gameboys, and the old computer which they had to specify was loading.

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I don't remember liking this one.

<br><br><br>

# Avengers: Endgame (2019)
Watched: July 30

![Still](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/endgame.jpg)

You can take pretty much everything I said about _Infinity War_ and add it here too. It's just so epic, ties together all the previous movies and really gives you the reward for having watched them all, and makes you so happy and emotional you cry. Seeing all the heroes come back and re-assemble was awesome. I never thought I would be excited for Doctor Strange.

Also I gotta give respect where respect is due, they re-created a scene from _Infinity War_ that I cried for, and I cried for it here again. The one who died here is one of my favorite characters so it really stung. 

I also have to give props for the plot. I was actually really into it. Might be the best time travel movie.

However, I was not a fan of how Captain America went back in time to live with Peggy. I mean I'm happy for him and all that but I'm sad he got old and basically retired because I wanted to see more of him. Although, now that they opened the gate for time travelling who knows.

I didn't feel the same fear that I did watching _Infinity War_. For IW I was genuinely terrified of what was gonna happen. Here, not as much, because even if I hadn't gotten spoiled prior to watching it I knew they would come back since the next MCU movie is a Spider-Man! With that logic I guess *she* will come back too?

Overall, this was the endgame I was going for - this movie was why I started watching the MCU, because I thought it was gonna end with this one. It was well worth it, but it doesn't end here.

10/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

In retrospect I really like Infinity War alot more, so I kinda wanna pull its score down to a 9/10, but what's done is done.

# Lucy (2014)

![Still](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/lucy.jpg)

Someone recommended this movie on [https://reddit.com/r/oled](/r/OLED) so I figured I'd look it up and to my surprise it was a ScarJo movie so I checked it out immediately (I really like her from the MCU movies if you haven't figured it out yet.)

And yeah, it definitively is a pretty movie on OLED. It's one of those real 4K ones too. It's really bright and vivid, and has cool bright colorful effects everywhere. So yes, I can definitely recommend watching it just for that. It's not my favorite OLED movie, but it's up there.

Now for the movie itself... I don't know what to say. It started out very interesting, I got a _Kill Bill_ vibe from it, but that enthusiasm died out pretty fast when it turned into a _Morgan Freeman_ National Geographic special. And then my enthusiasm came back when she went bad ass and killed everyone in her way, and then it was boring again and I don't even know what happened in the end.

5/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I only remember ScarJo and that it looked great on OLED.

I kinda liked the first half but the 2nd half was very boring and just depressing. Glad it had a happy ending though. 

I'm also not the biggest _Elton John_ fan. Apart from _Rocketman_ I don't know if I've heard any of the songs. I actually thought he was dead in real life going into this movie. I guess I got it confused with _Bohemian Rhapsody_.

Pretty forgettable. Haven't really thought about it since I watched it.

Apart from the really funny stuff like the boating and the chocolate bar this movie was below mediocre. I don't get it.

I still don't get this movie. Should probably rewatch it.

# Miss Congeniality (2000)
Watched: Sep 21

The plot of this movie sounded incredibly stupid, I like Sandra Bullock, and they mentioned it on Seincast - I had to watch it.

And yeah, it is incredibly stupid and silly but I liked it. I laughed many times and really enjoyed it. 

It's incredible to me how many stupid movies Sandra Bullock has been in.

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I remember this being a silly movie, like, really silly. I should watch the sequel.

# El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019)
Watched: Oct 11

Ultimately this movie is fan service, but it's damn good fan service - you definitively need to see Breaking Bad first. 

I thought it was fantastic. Very interesting camera angles also, keeps you interested because you're like "oh this is a weird camera angle".

9/10

I remember it being fantastic but haven't really thought about it much.

Ah, very happy to have finally seen this as alot of movies, tv shows and games have references to this movie. And yeah, it's a fantastic movie. But I gotta say that I was a little disappointed with the last hour or so of the movie - it just got sad. 

But up until then, it was awesome. The chainsaw scene, the nightclub scenes, all the bright sun, Miami, the music... it was just fantastic. I love the 80s. The "Push It To The Limit"-montage was awesome, but after that is when it went downhill.

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

One of my favorite movies this year. The _Push it to the Limit_ montage is awesome. I'll probably rewatch it some day.

Danny DeVito looks alot different. I couldn't recognize him, so I had to look up who he was supposed to be playing, and I still couldn't recognize him.

Jack Nicholson looks like Johnny Knoxville. Judging from a quick Google search a lot of people think this.

Apart from those two observations I found the movie very meh.

I still don't get this movie. I don't know why everyone likes it so much.

The first hour or so of the movie, until he gets arrested basically, was really fantastic. But after that it got kinda boring and cliché. 

I recommend watching _The 8-Bit Guy's_ video on how telephone phreaking worked, that's why I wanted to watch this movie: [How Telephone Phreaking Worked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tHyZdtXULw). Fascinating stuff. If you have to decide between watching the movie or that video, watch that video.

Really funny movie. Had some really sweet moments too. 

Alot of old guys around where I live actually act like these two so it felt very relatable. 

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I loved this movie. I was gonna watch the sequel but still haven't. I should get on that.

(Sidenote on Nov 20: I went to work, felt incredible pain in my stomach so I aborted mission after 1 hour and went home, and then watched these 3 movies so I felt somewhat productive atleast.)

Oh hey it's Kate from _Friends_! Oh, it's Sue Ellen Mischke from Seinfeld! Oh hey it's Hank from Breaking Bad!

Apart from recognizing actors from TV shows I've seen, I really didn't care for this movie. I guess I'm not just into sci-fi, because I just lose all interest whenever they're firing at aliens. 

Oh and the 4K restoration of this movie is incredible. It's so sharp and colors are incredible in HDR.

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I watched it in VR in a cinema, and that is how I remember this movie. I should probably rewatch it because I greatly misunderstood it. After my friend explained it to me it seemed a lot better.

# Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker (2019)
Watched: Dec 21

![Still](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/starwars9.jpg)

Not great, not bad. I didn't love it or hate it. I just struggled through it and eventually paid attention to the last 20 minutes and was like: "alright".  It felt rushed though. 

I still hate Kylo Ren. It's been 3 movies with him now and I still can't stand him. He looks like an edgy teenlord and has the worst voice in the world. And that stupid face... just god, kill him.

Lando being back seems like it should've been a big deal but nope it really wasn't. 

I think it's my least favorite out of this trilogy. I know people hated _The Last Jedi_ but I can't really remember what was wrong with it.

I'll rewatch it later probably because I just saw a "low quality" version of it now. I'm curious to see how Carrie Fisher looks, seeing as she's been dead for years now. 

But yeah, go watch it if you care about this trilogy I guess. I just get sad thinking about how lovely and awesome the end of ROTJ was. They kinda paid tribute to it in this movie but ROTJ left me feeling happier. I just don't care about these characters as much.

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I don't remember it being particularly good and after seeing other reviews of it afterwards it seems like a really terrible movie.

# The Godfather (1972)
Watched: Dec 26

![Still](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/godf1.jpg)

Big fish to tackle here for me. I went in with skyhigh expectations and that might've screwed me.

It was very exciting when they set up Michael's hit in the restaurant, and then seeing him actually doing that. 
Michael (Al Pacino) in general was badass as hell to see. 

But other than that, I wasn't that into it. I don't think I have enough class to appreciate a movie like this. It had some nice surprises here and there and the murders and beatings were exciting but other than that, kind of boring. 

8/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I think this was my favorite of the three afterall. Vito was one hell of a character and I missed him in the others (well, he was there in Part II but not as Marlon Brando).

<br><br><br>

# The Godfather: Part II (1974)
Watched: Dec 29-30

![Still](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/godf2.jpg)

I liked all the murders, especially Vito's revenge on Don Ciccio.

I’m sad for Michael. I’m sad for Kay. 

First half was boring and hard for me to get through (hence why it took two days to watch it). I really liked the second half. 

That intermission was really eerie. Haven’t seen one before. I don't really know why they left it in the Blu-ray but I suppose it was there on the original film reel so they left it in for authenticity.

Overall, I really liked how it's a prequel and sequel. Really cool concept. And it switches between them in a very good way I thought.

7/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

I think this could be my favorite if I rewatched it. I really like the prequel/sequel thing. 

<br><br><br>

# The Godfather: Part III (1990)
Watched: Dec 30-31

![Still](https://lambdan.se/img/blogpics2019/movies2019/godf3.jpg)

Mary really sticks out for some reason. She does not fit in with the rest at all. 

Finally hearing the original “just when I thought I was out” quote I was feeling very underwhelmed. I actually missed it and had to go back. Really nothing special at all. I can't believe it's like the most quoted phrase from these movies.

The whole opera sequence was awesome. I liked Vincent as the Don, being a coordinator. 

The ending was good I thought. It’s kind of cheap to have a montage and then fast-forward to Michael being old and dying in his chair but it worked for me. 

Overall, I thought Part III was good enough, at least the 2nd half. The first half was extremely slow, even more so than Part II. 
But I don’t feel like the acting was as good as the other movies. Especially Mary (Sofia Coppola), she just felt really out of place all the time. After watching I read that a lot of people did not like her.

6/10

## Retrospective Thoughts

Well, I just watched it so my retrospective thoughts are the same as above. Only thing I'll add is I'll probably rewatch the trilogy once it's available in 4K.

<br><br><br>

# Rewatched Movies

### Titanic (1997)
As I said, I watched it with my nephews. I think it still holds up.

### Dr. No (1962)
I like watching the very old Bond movies. They're classy, chill and just pleasant to watch. 

### Die Hard (1988)
Waited the entire year for December to watch it again. First thing I did December 1st: open up my iPad and started watching it. It's so freaking good.

### Die Hard 2 (1990)
This movie is tons of fun. I enjoyed rewatching it. I mean it's alot stupider than the first one but it's fun.
