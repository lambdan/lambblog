Did you like Astros Playroom that came with your PS5? Great, this is more of that!

I loved Astros Playroom so I was very excited when I found about this game coming out. And once the game was out, I didn't rush through it because I wanted it to last. And it was great!

Some levels were frustrating. Most of them were fun. Some of them were OK. It's just good all around.

Music is awesome. Graphics were awesome. Controls were awesome (although I gotta say my PS5 controller were louder than my TV at times.)

Not much more to say. It really just boils down to: if you like Playstation and you liked Astros Playroom, you will probably like this one too.

I did not get the platinum trophy... yet... I'll probably get around to doing that.
