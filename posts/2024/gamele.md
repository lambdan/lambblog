# gamele.app

Here's what I worked on this week: [gamele.app](https://gamele.app).

It's like [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) but for game screenshots.

Currently it has screenshots for these systems:

- NES
- SNES
- N64
- GameBoy
- Genesis/Mega Drive
- Playstation 1

I plan on adding more, or maybe combine them all.

Great programming exercise it was.
