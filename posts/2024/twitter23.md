# Deactivated Twitter

I just deactivated my main Twitter account. 

Why now? I don’t know. Maybe the doge logo was the final straw, though, I gotta admit I kinda liked it. 

Nah but I’ve been on the edge of deactivating my Twitter account for a good while now. I just… don’t get any joy from it anymore, and it just keeps getting worse and worse. 

If you miss me, you can talk to me on Discord: djs#8437. 

I’ll be here. I’m good. Thanks for all the memories over the years. Twitter got me through some very dark lonely times. I don’t have much of those dark times anymore and life is great.
