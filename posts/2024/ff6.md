# Final Fantasy VI

I finally finished FF6 yesterday. This is a game I’ve had on my backlog for quite some time… probably as long as I’ve had the concept of a backlog. 

But it’s finally checked off. 

What did I think about it? It was great! Music is amazing, probably top 5 video game OSTs or something. 

Gameplay is fun. There are so many abilities and  espers and combinations you can use. It was pretty easy though, probably the easiest FF I’ve played. 

I played the Pixel Remaster version. And I think I’m pretty happy I did because I’ve looked at some SNES footage and boy, that UI is cramped. 
I used a SNES font and music mod though so I got best of both worlds. I do have the original cartridge so maybe someday I’ll play through it on there as well. 

Anyway, I don’t have much else to say. This game has been out for so many years and so many people have raved about it so I don’t need to. 

It’s really good and fun. Music is one of the best ever. Story was interesting enough (I do feel like they had an unnecessary amount of characters though, I didn’t really get attached to anyone because there were so many). 

But yeah, this should be a game on your “games to beat before I die” list.
