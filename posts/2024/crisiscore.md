# Crisis Core... One of the worst games I've ever played

Just finished Crisis Core. Or to be more specific, `CRISIS CORE -FINAL FANTASY VII- REUNION` (great title!)

I know I usually put a screenshot when I make these posts but no... not with this game... I just cant bother.

Lets get the good stuff out of the way:

- Music is decent

Okay, now lets get to the bad stuff:

- Zack's voice acting is just... not good
- Zack's vibe is just... awkward
- Takes too long between retrying battles
- The death dogs that cast Death on you <1 secs into a battle. Great idea whoever thought of that!
- Poorly compressed FMV's (I know its a PSP game originally but bleh)
- The whole structure of the game. Activating Combat Mode, Conflict Resolved, Missions, Small Areas... I still know its a PSP game originally but it did not age well.

Zack is just... not my kind of guy.

Yeah, no, I really hated this game. I kinda regret playing it and wish I just watched the necessary story parts on YouTube instead.

Anyway, ready for Remake Part 2 now. I pre-ordered it.
