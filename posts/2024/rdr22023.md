# Red Dead Redemption II - Still Incredible

I've been gushing over RDR2 lately. I played through it again earlier in the year, and it was incredible. And I feel like it gets better with age. I don't think we quite got how good it was when it released. But now its been over 5 years and it is still incredible. 

It still looks amazing. There are so many details. All the audio design is amazing. The art direction is amazing. The story is incredible. 

I still get annoyed by how slow some things are in it. Being forced to walk in the camp... picking up things... skinning animals... it's all very slow and tedious, but on the other hand, it's also what makes the game. 

It also really makes you think what Rockstar is gonna do with GTA 6. The trailer looks amazing. And looking at how incredible RDR2 was 5 years ago, it's hard to not get excited.

So go play RDR2! I'm pretty sure it's on sale right now. 

Or just go on YouTube and watch some clickbaity "rdr2 things you missed" videos. They're cool too.
