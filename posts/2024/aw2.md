# Alan Wake 2

- Beautiful game. Very demanding on my computer though, almost felt like I needed a RTX 4090 to properly enjoy it... I ended up lowering resolution and other settings instead :(
- Very weird and very interesting story. That's why I kept playing it. 
- Mediocre gameplay otherwise. I kinda liked the mind place stuff but the combat was very... irrelevant.
- I love the Finnish stuff

I would write more about it but it's impossible without ruining the story for you so I'm not. I'll just leave you these screenshots.

If you're looking for a very slow paced, weird game, and don't mind jump scares (and you have a beefy computer) I can highly recommend.
