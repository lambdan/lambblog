# RSS Feed Is Proper Now
https://github.com/lambdan/lambblog/commit/3e185b486c04a1e345b10af6f135aa99062f4f00

I've changed lambblog so that the actual post contents is now in the `description` field so that it shows up properly in RSS Readers, like [NetNewsWire for Mac](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/): 

![NetNewsWire](https://lambdan.se/img/Screenshot%202020-01-22%20at%2019.48.45.png)
<figcaption>(Please ignore the duplicate post entries in NetNewsWire, they're leftovers from debugging.</figcaption>

Enjoy!
