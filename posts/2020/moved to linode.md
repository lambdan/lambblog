# Moved to Linode

After hearing about Linode on podcasts, and my old VPS provider pissing me off, I've now moved to Linode!

And if you are reading this on May 28th, it means I managed to do so!

I really hate re-setting up apache, php, letsencrypt etc, but it had to be done.

So yeah, this is just more of a test post.

I think my site feels a little snappier? Atleast it's SSD storage now.

Linode is pretty cool so far anyway.
