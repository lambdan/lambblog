# Back to the Future 3 Movie and Sega Genesis Game References

I made these back in May but haven't really organized them anywhere.

There are probably more of them but these are the ones I found on first "try" and immediately thought of.

People might not like the game but I think they did an admirable job incorporating details from the movie.

(And yes, there is really just 4 stages/levels in the game.)

If you'd like to watch a speedrun of the game, you could watch mine:
