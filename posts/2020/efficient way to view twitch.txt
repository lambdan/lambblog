# Most Efficient Way to Watch Twitch in macOS

I rarely use the Twitch website to watch streams.

Instead I use my own little script called [whoislive](https://github.com/lambdan/whoislive) to see who is live, and then I watch it using [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/). 

And then, if I really wanna look at chat, I use IRC, specifically irssi. [Here's a quick little guide how to set up that](https://gist.github.com/lambdan/4d9ac5a63e56c6d1d9169f5b81de9dd6).

What's interesting about streamlink is that it can just give you an URL to the video stream, so you can use practically any video player to watch it.

I've been using [mpv](https://mpv.io/) which I like for its simplicity and minimalism, but I noticed my [2020 MBP](https://lambdan.se/blog/2020/06/08/going-from-a-2010-macbook-pro-to-a-2020-macbook-pro/) gets really hot doing so.

So I started looking into alternatives. Most interesting to me was to use Apple's own Quicktime Player. Seeing as its theirs, it should be the most efficient for macOS... right?

I did some quick tests. I just opened the stream in each player and looked at Acitivity Monitor for a while to see what kind of CPU and GPU usage I got, I figure lower is better.

- Brave (Chrome) and Safari gets more CPU usage because they also see the chat, but it's still not bad. Thank god we don't use Flash anymore.
- Quicktime and VLC are practically the same. Streamlink uses VLC by default. Quicktime gets some native OS bonuses though, like Picture-in-Picture, so might be worth using it for that.
- IINA is probably good too, the numbers were kind of jumping so it might be the same as QT/VLC. It took a very long time to load up the stream in it though.
- mpv uses a shocking amount of CPU and I don't really know why.

I'm gonna start using Quicktime for Twitch I think. Here's a nice little line i put in my `.zshrc` to make it easier: 

	ttvQT () { open -a "quicktime player" $(streamlink twitch.tv/$@ best --stream-url) ;}

This way I just open up terminal and type in for example `ttvQT heyzeusherestoast` and boom, QT opens up with the stream:

And I can put QT into PiP to watch it while doing other stuff:

For fun I also looked at the Energy tab in Activity Monitor and looked at the "Energy Impact" metric for a couple of the players. I have no idea what that exactly is or how it's calculated, but I figure lower is better:
