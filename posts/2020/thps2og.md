# Game Beaten: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (PS1)

I know I said in my review for 1+2 that I didn't see any reason for why anyone would go back and play the originals when the remake exists, but here I am.

I've been watching a ton of Tony Hawk playthroughs on YouTube and THPS2 keeps popping up so I did eventually stumble upon playing it. I didn't play it on the original console - I played it on my Raspberry Pi 4 through Lakka which is basically RetroArch. It worked very well.

One thing I find interesting about THPS2 is that the soundtrack is so good that I don't really think of it as an old game. Sure, the graphics are absolutely dreadful and the controls are so stiff and slow, but for what it is and for the time period I guess it was alright. 

Anyway, I had kinda fun. The Bullring ran at miserable framerates, I'm guessing low teens. Not sure if its because of emulation or if it really was that laggy on original hardware too.
