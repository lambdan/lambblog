# Movies I Watched in 2020

No frames from movies this year because frankly, it's a lot more extra work to find an interesting frame and take a screenshot and label it properly. 

Didn't watch a whole lotta movies this year. I was planning on doing the LOTR trilogy now that it's on 4K Blu-ray, but I didn't. They are so long.

I watched 31 movies this year.

# Frozen 2 (2019)

"Anna, I just thought of one thing that's permanent... Love." üôÑ

Apart from the visuals (especially that scene where it was mostly black and there was some vivid colors) I really can't say much positive about this one.

I didn't like any of the songs. Well, All is Found was nice but the rest of them were pretty forgettable and just annoying (Into the Unknown). Frozen 1 had classics like Let it go, Do you wanna build a snowman, For the first time in forever and Frozen Heart.

I didn't get into or care for the story. What even was the story? Elsa heard a voice and followed it, they found their parents ship and discovered Arrendale was a lie so they open the dam and blast it with water and that's it?

Just a very uninteresting movie overall.

## Retrospective Thoughts
I was planning on going back and watching it again once it was on Blu-ray, but didn't.

# Bad Moms (2016)

* Only reason I watched this was the cast
* Had some fun stuff, like the bathroom mirror foreskin discussion
* Other than that, very mediocre and uninteresting
* Especially the slow-motion montages that are set to music are so stupid
* Probably not a movie for me

I remember kinda liking this one.

# A Bad Moms Christmas (2017)

* Oh great, more stupid slow-motion montages
* YAY! Cheryl Hines. Curb represent. I also recognize the other mothers. Amy's mom is Leonard's mom in TBBT, and Carla's mom is in Friends.
* Carla falling in love with the guy getting his crotch waxed was fun
* Other than all that, this movie was pretty awful

# Baby Mama (2008)

* Only reason I am aware of this movie is because it had a really dumb Family Guy cutaway and the cover art is maybe the most incredible cover art ever
* Why do I wanna watch it? Tina Fey and Amy Poehler
* That's all my notes

## Retrospective Thoughts
I remember it being really bad.

# Pulp Fiction (1994) 

* What the girl screams at the beginning when initiating the robbery and Misirlou starts playing is burned into my brain because back in the days I had some mp3 of Misirlou which had that part left in. The file was called "Pulp fiction.mp3"
* The apartment/big mac/Samuel L Jackson scene is one of my favorite scenes of all time. It's so funny. I've seen it before many times.
* Vincent walking into Mias house and she starts talking to him over the intercom is very funny. That's where the confused meme is from!
* All the stuff that happens in the record shop is amazing. The whole Gold Watch segment is amazing really. This might be better than the apartment/big mac from earlier.
* The Bonnie Situation is amazing. The Wolf is amazing.
* The hold-up at the end is amazing. Samuel L Jackson is amazing.

Overall, a really amazing and funny movie with twists I never saw coming. And I laughed alot.

I would've liked to have more Uma Thurman. She was really interesting in this one, but unfortunately she is basically just in the first half of it.

There was also some sections where they just went on talking for too damn long about things I didn't care about. I wanna say The Gold Watch story was one of them but the end of it pays off so it might be worth it. Stuff like Vincent and Mia at the dance place and Butch with Fabienne at the motel I could do without.

## Retrospective Thoughts
I remember loving this one. I still think about the record shop scene and how amazing that was.

# Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019)

Very boring, until he got to the farm. Unfortunately that's about 1.5 hours in.
And then it‚Äôs boring as heck again for a little while until we get to the last 20 mins or so, which are very entertaining and over the top.

So basically you could cut this movie to be good:

* start with cliff driving around and picking up that girl that needs to go to the farm
* Include all of the farm stuff (cliff being a stuntman for a famous actor gets set up here when talking to George)
* Cliff beats the **** out of the guy
* The ranch gang now has a motive for revenge
* Cut to when the ranch gang comes to ricks house
* End when the ambulance with cliff drives away

And that‚Äôs the movie. 2 hours shorter and a lot better.

The stuff at the end was so good that I‚Äôll stretch to a 6. If it wasn‚Äôt for that I might given it something very low.

## Retrospective Thoughts
Eww.

# Grand Theft Auto Girls (2020)

* I really can't figure out a target audience for this movie. Girls who've been caught stealing cars maybe? How many of those are there?
* Movies are fiction so it's pretty pointless and dumb to bring this up, but I'm gonna do it anyway: this movie is very unrealistic.
* Movie is actually, or well, tries to be, a lot darker than you think. The movie seems at first like an innocent, fun movie but it actually goes pretty dark.

I remember this being the weirdest movie ever.

# Late Night (2019)

* That Katherine lady was so mean, I hate her
* Yeah that's all I have to say. It was fine. I didn't mind it.

Huh... kinda forgot about this one.

# Mean Girls (2004)

* I wanted to watch this movie because it was mentioned on some podcast, but I can't remember what podcast or in what context.
* Ah yes, *Lacey Chabert* of Family Guy fame. I think this is the first time I have seen her. I love her character.
* *Amy Poehler*'s character was nuts
* So much Swedish talk. Swedish calorie bars, everyone in Africa talks Swedish, do you know Swedish?
* Fun movie, it's really fun to watch
* The last 15 mins or so were not as entertaining

## Retrospective Thoughts
I love this movie. I think I went back and re-watched it? Watched a lot of videos on Youtube about it anyway.

# Parasite (2019)

Like everyone else, I wanted to watch this movie after it won the Oscars. And yeah, I loved itI don‚Äôt really know what my favorite part was. Was it how smart it was with how they all got their jobs? Was it them hiding under the table while they had sex on the sofa? Was it the first time they went down the basement? Was it when the guy got the knife and went on a massacre? Was it the fathers letter? Was it the sons plan? There are so many good parts.

I do think hearing the sons plan was my favorite part. It made me almost cry. Seeing the father come up the stairs, music stopped, and they‚Äôre in the backyard was beautiful. I wish it would've ended when they hugged but no, it cuts back to the present where the plan isn't done yet. I hope he succeeds.

I don't really understand why it's called *Parasite*? I think it's because first one of them got a job, then the rest came with that? I don‚Äôt know.

I still rewatch the ending here and there. It's very good still.

# Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)

Disclaimer: I am not the hugest Sonic fan. I am barely a fan at all of him. Or no, I just don't like him at all. I don't hate him or anything but I'm not a fan. But I decided to watch this movie anyway because of all the drama that was his original design, and you know, _v i d e o  g a m e s_.

I thought this movie was pretty boring overall. It's just 1.5 hours but it took me an entire day to get through it, I could only watch 10 mins at a time before I lost focus. The jokes didn't really land with me. It was only the last 30 mins where I really got into it and really enjoyed it.

There were some other good parts too, like his favorite movie being _Speed_ (I like that movie too). And Jim Carrey was turned up to 11, or maybe he always is like that.

And Sonic also looked really cute. I love this design, I wanna make him my profile picture everywhere (but I'm not a Sonic fan in general so that would be wrong).
That original design will live on in the back of my head though, I saved the trailer for it in case it gets wiped from the internet somehow.

I hope to see a sequel. The setup is there.

I've been meaning to rewatch this one too, but haven't.

# Clue (1985)

Ever since I started listening to [Seincast](https://seincast.libsyn.com/) I wanted to see this movie because they reference this movie all the damn time. So now I finally did watch it and, yeah, I liked it. 

One thing that distracted me though (which might be intentional) was that all the women had a ton of cleavage. Looked like the maid was about to have a wardrobe malfunction constantly. Kept you hooked I guess.

The movie feels like a cult classic. I feel like I should hear more people talk about it.

# Horrible Bosses 2 (2014)

I remember still being very sick when I watched this one. It was just around the time covid broke out.

# Hot Shots! (1991)

Very dumb but very fun. Dialogue like:

"Admiral Benson!"
- "Really? That's my name too!"

had me rolling.

I noticed in the Blu-ray I was watching theres a tear or a hair to the far left during the last 20 minutes or so.

I remember laughing my ass off at this one.

# Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979)

I'm not gonna sugar coat it: this movie sucks.

The special effects are horrible and very distracting.

For long periods of time nothing happens and it's just very boring. If I have trouble falling asleep some night maybe I'll put this on again.

Good music though, I guess that's the only thing I didn't hate.

I remember this one being horrible.

# Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)

After the first one, I was re-considering whether I should watch these movies or not but I am glad I did watch this one because Wrath of Khan is awesome.

The worm to ear scene honestly kinda freaked me out. Very disturbing.

I also now know the origins of many classic lines and parodies in The Big Bang Theory and Family Guy. Things like the funeral.

The famous KHAAAAAAAAAN! scream is from here too, which they've parodied in Seinfeld. But in Seinfeld, the camera spins from above... Here, nothing like that happens... So I'm not really sure what that Seinfeld thing is all about.

# Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984)

Christopher Lloyd is always a treat.

Epic explosion.

Story was very ridiculous. I was kinda out of it.

I remember watching this entire movie while being on the exercise bike, and then going up to the attic to fix a door that blew open.

# Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986)

Double dumbass on you!

Fun when they try talking to the computer.

Love it when they‚Äôre in the hospital.

You kinda forget what the movie is really about when you‚Äôre in the 80s. Then when they get the whales it‚Äôs like ‚Äúwait what did they need them for again?‚Äù

This was the main movie of the original Star Treks I wanted to see, because they were gonna talk about it on the [Upgrade Podcast](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/293), but I decided to go the extra miles and watch the previous movies too.

# Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)

Watched in preparation for the Upgrade podcast once again, [episode 299](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/299) this time.

I don‚Äôt have many notes because I was just hooked and laughed my ass off. It‚Äôs a very funny movie.

Lots of Family Guy references from this movie that I recognized.

One section I didn‚Äôt like was towards the end with Cameron. He got really real and serious... super weird vibe which kinda killed the mood.

The day after I watched it, I re-watched it! That's a very good sign that it's a good movie.

## Retrospective Thoughts
Probably my favorite movie of the year. I rewatched it atleast once I remember. It's one of my favorite movies ever now.

# Jaws (1975)

Been wanting to see Jaws ever since Charlie mentioned it in Two and a half men. 
And I got close to watching it multiple times, especially when I got my OLED TV and really got into watching movies. 
But the 4K Blu-ray wasn‚Äôt available and I wanted that, so I waited for it, and it finally got here. 

So I watched it and, frankly, I didn't like it that much. It was very mediocre. And my favorite guy died, so that sucked.

# Midsommar (2019)

I loved this movie. It was so weird and intriguing I couldn't stop watching it.

I usually watch movies with subtitles on, just to help hear what they're saying but for this one, since they talk Swedish quite a bit, I turned off subtitles and instead watched it with my Airpods Pro with noise cancelling on, and it was amazing because it was like I was actually there.

I imagine people who doesn't know Swedish finds the Swedish parts odd, but I found them hillarious. Hearing them talk casual Swedish in the middle of this insanity was really funny.

I also loved the actor playing Dani. She was really great. I'm happy she ended up happy.

Overall, one of the most interesting and inappropriately hillarious movies I've seen.

# Pretending I'm a Superman: The Tony Hawk Video Game Story (2020)

I love the video games so of course I wanted to watch this.

Unfortunately, I was a bit let down. It wasn't necessarily bad but it wasn't as informative as I would've liked it to be. It was just more of a celebration of the series and skateboarding.

I would've liked more details and stories about the making of the games.

# Predator (1987)

Some good quotes and memes in here, and it had some really funny parts with all the explosions and action stuff, but the predator was genuinely terrifying. That's why I think it was a bit of a letdown when they unmasked him towards the end. I think it would've been more interesting if we never got to know what it was.

I've been wanting to watch this movie for a while because I hear it mentioned here and there. And I love Reese Witherspoon. But there were some other familiar faces here too, like Luke Wilson, Jennifer Coolidge and Holland Taylor.
