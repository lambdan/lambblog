# Game Beaten: Astro's Playroom (PS5)

What a treat. Just delightful. There needs to be more games like this.

And this is ain't even really a full game, it's more of a tech demo, but it's amazing. Being a Playstation fan and playing this is delightful. Everyone making this game must've been happy. 

I loved going through and exploring every little corner and finding references to old Playstation stuff and games. Every little corner has some kind of reference in it and its a delight to see the creativity.

The game is like a celebration of Playstation, and when you've just gotten a new Playstation, that is exactly what you need. It's fantastic and puts you in a really good mood.

I don't really know what to say, because part of the charm is going through it yourself and finding everything. I don't wanna spoil it. Just play the game, get all the stuff, and then enjoy a day in Playstation Labo and try everything you can think of.

Just go play the game and enjoy and celebrate Playstation. This is not a game worth reading about.

The controls are good, the music is good, the graphics are good, the references are great, the load times are short... it's just perfect. Just go play it... if you can.

# The PS5 Itself

So how is the PS5 itself?

It's fine. It's about what I expected:

- It's huge. It had to go down on the floor, only place I had any room for it: ![Floor](https://lambdan.se/img/2020-12-05_18-13-19.923904.jpg)
- It's very quiet and cold (I don't know if I got a super unit or something, but mine runs very cool and is very quiet, no coil whine or anything)
- It loads absurdly fast. Like in _Black Ops Cold War_ you practically instantly get the "Pick a class" menu up after the load screen starts.
- PS4 Backwards Compatibility is fine
- The controller is very comfortable. I'm not super impressed by the adaptive triggers and haptics and stuff, but it's neat.

I really like the automatic microphone recording when recording video. Yeah, privacy implications are a thing of course, but it's neat. Like here's my live reaction when playing one of the speedrun levels:

While playing I didn't think about it recording, but after finishing it I was like "god that was intense... oh! I probably got it recorded!" - and sure enough I did.

I only got it yesterday so I still have a lot to test and mess with, but my initial impressions are very good. Very happy to finally have one. It's not easy and I feel for anyone wanting one and can't get one right now. Hopefully the stock situation will get better.
