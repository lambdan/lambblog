# Disabling Turbo Boost on Intel Laptops
https://marco.org/2020/01/13/macos-low-power-mode-redux

Marco's post is about Macs specifically but I think this should apply to Windows laptops too.

I've been trying this on my ancient 2010 Macbook Pro and it makes it a lot more pleasant to use in my lap. It runs quieter and cooler and is more comfortable in my lap since it's not as hot.

I highly recommend you trying it if you can. On Mac you can (for now) use [Turbo Boost Switcher](https://www.rugarciap.com/turbo-boost-switcher-for-os-x/). On PC I'm not really sure what you can use, maybe you can just disable it in BIOS?
