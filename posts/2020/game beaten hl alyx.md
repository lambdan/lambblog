# Game Beaten: Half-Life: Alyx

I beat the game yesterday and I started writing a really long post about this game, a 6679 characters long post, before I stopped.

I just couldn't do it justice. This game is epic and has so many things about it that I wanna talk about, but my writing really can't do it and I don't wanna ruin it for anyone. So here's all I have to say:

<center>**Half-Life: Alyx is incredible and I would recommend everyone who has the opportunity to play it.**</center>

I was skeptical it could be done, but Valve really did it: a VR game I love.

I might write more about it later, [just like I was planning on doing with Earthbound](https://lambdan.se/blog/2018/06/06/game-beaten-earthbound/), but still haven't. Some games are just too epic for me to write my thoughts down properly.
